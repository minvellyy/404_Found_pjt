중립,Hera black cushion. You'll have to pry it out of my dead hands. My sister uses JSM and it oxidizes quite a bit. I would keep that in mind when picking a shade ,3
긍정,"I’m a fan of the jungsaemool cushion! Coverage and staying power is so great!! I used to have to reapply every few hours but with jsm I only reapply once.

And it’s not just the formula. The cushion it comes with is really good. Quite dense so when you’re patting it on your skin it feels firm but airy.",3
긍정,"Which Clio cushion do you use? I used the pink mesh one for the longest time and eventually after trying a few other cushions I’m sticking with JSM essential skin cushion! 

It really depends on what you want from a cushion though, I stopped using the Clio mesh cushion because high coverage cushions tend to look cakey on me no matter how much I thin it out, and their darkest shade was just slightly too light.

The texture and finish on the red TirTir cushion is great, but it oxidizes a ton. Like at the end of the day I’m just orange. I’ve tried their silver and white cushion and those don’t oxidize as much, but I didn’t like how it sat on my skin unfortunately.

I like JSM right now just because it feels like it has medium coverage and I don’t have to apply a ton. It’ll cover my redness and most dark spots, and I can just conceal over everything that it doesn’t cover. 

I’ve heard great things about Hera, I just feel a bit hesitant dropping that much on a cushion when they don’t last very long. The last time I bought a cushion that expensive was 5 years ago on a $75 amorepacific cushion. Decent cushion, but it was comparable to every other cushion foundation at $20-30",1
긍정,TirTir Aura in the silver packaging has been a great match for my mature and dehydrated skin. It has a sheer coverage and dewy comfortable finish.,1
중립,Laneige Glow CC Cushion!,1
중립,"Tir Tir Aura cusion (silver one) gives a natural, lightweight dewy finish, with no oxidation on my combo skin. It just makes your skin look better and hydrated rather than hiding it. It works well with their mask fit waterproof setting spray too",1
중립,"Laneige green matte one. I have gone through more than 5 refills. Its matte and super coverage yet very thin at the same time. I brush my teeth after every meals and with the water and toothpaste running to my chin and around mouth area, it doesn't look patchy at all.",1
긍정,"I love my clio cushion, but I do find that it works best when my skin is more oily. I tried JSM but the fragrance was too strong.",1
중립,You sold me. Everyone always raves about the Hera black cushion ,2
긍정,"I second the JSM recommendation!   
I really love the JSM essential skin nuder cushion for everyday makeup. Super quick to apply, and the finish is very natural. I also enjoy the JSM skin nuder cover layer cushion. It's higher coverage & more matte, I just need to make sure my skin prep is hydrated and they both perform well.

  
I've also tried the pink and the green CLIO cushions. I find the CLIO a bit heavier than JSM, but it is very glowy and the finish is great too. CLIO usually goes for $10-20 cheaper than JSM cushions (both usually come with replacement cushions too)",1
중립,Fyi global amore sells the Hera black cushion base + refill for $60. So it's pretty comparable to most other cushions at that price point,1
긍정,"You're already sold but I'll sell it to you more! Medium-high coverage with a semi-matte finish. I have a lot of PIE and some redness, and it makes my skin look pretty even and blurred. You'll still need concealer for stubborn dark spots, but I'm pretty happy walking around without. It has great staying power (but do I go over it with a setting powder and spray). At the end of the day, it hasn't separated or caked on me. It's not drying nor greasy. I've only ever had it cling to dry patches when I overexfoliated big time. And even then, it wasn't that bad. Love it to bits. Also the case feels so luxurious! It is pricey for a cushion though, but not terribly so ($60 for base + refill).",2
중립,Oh so it’s my dream cushion. Noted. Now I’m really sold. $60 is actually pretty reasonable for a cushion and refill. Where do you buy yours? ,1
중립,I get mine from the global amore online store. Olive young has it too but for some reason they only sell the base (no refill) for $60 which is wild,2
긍정,I use the Jsm long wear cushion and love it. I hear it’s very comparable to the black Hera cushion. I will say I do use the Jsm fixing spray and mool cream also. I don’t know if that makes a huge difference but the Jsm long wear cushion has literally been my favorite cushion so far.,5
중립,"I go back and forth between both based on how my skin is feeling and the climate I am in. JSM is higher coverage and definitely the dewier finish of the 2. I do find it's more build buildable, and I prefer it over Hera now that I have learned how to use it. It stays on better for all day for me esp when I need some better coverage that still looks natural. My tips for JSM: use the inside lid with the bumpy pattern to pat out the cushion and even it out on the puff. Also, start light and build layers. I find it works better on dry areas, like under the eye if you use a sweeping motion, then gently pat to blend while areas like the cheek are okay to apply using just a patting motion. If you live in a humid climate *and* have combo or oily skin you can feel the product more than I prefer, but it's honestly very manageable.

Hera is much lighter coverage and shade range. It gives a natural skin like finish, but this also means it can be harder for dry patches. It also doesn't stay as well as JSM, and I could not get better coverage even with building layers on. Therefore, I only use Hera when I want a super natural look. The cushion itself also holds a lot less product, and I found myself running out of it very quickly. It's not a bad cushion, but I do feel like my skin has to be in better condition for it to look as beautiful. 

I have combo-ish skin with a slightly oily t-zone. I have friends with oily skin who still choose the JSM and then just go in with a finishing powder to mattify areas. For me, they are not alike at all. I like Hera, but I love the JSM and will always reach for this over the Hera unless I am super oily and in 60%+ humidity conditions.",3
긍정,"My review might be outdated because it’s been many years since I tried a JSM cushion and I don’t know if they ever reformulated. I had the JSM essential star cealer foundation and found it to be very heavy. At the time I believe my skin was super oily and acne prone and this foundation was not for me. Currently I have the Hera silky stay 24h foundation for the summer since that’s when I’m the most oily and acne prone now and I find that the oil control is quite good. The coverage is light to medium depending on how much you layer on. I wouldn’t recommend it for dry areas since my skin felt very dry when I tried using this in the winter and that’s when I’m the most dry. I had to go buy the glow lasting 24h radiant foundation because of that. I think you might be able to get away with using the glow lasting 24h radiant foundation and just setting your t zone with powder since it’s not super dewy. Whereas with the silky stay 24h foundation, I feel like you run the risk of the foundation pilling and becoming cakey because the formulas dries really fast.",2
중립,I’ve tried both and I prefer JSM cushion. Easy to build up and stays on better throughout the day. With the Hera cushion I would notice it getting patchy under my eyes and around my mouth after a few hours. Even with reapplication it looked kind of weird.,2
중립,"The Hera cushion is waaay better. I had the jsm cushion and loved it at first, but for some reason it didn't last long for me at all. I was applying multiple layers and powdering, but it still melted after a long day at work. I bought the hera from an ebay seller in Korea and found it to be much better. I will say the jsm cushion does give a really lovely glowy and beautiful finish. I recommend trying both if you can they are pretty different. 

(I tried the essential skin nuder)",2
긍정,Thank you sooo much!! I might buy it todayy,2

중립,Picked up a cushion. I was deciding between 21 and 17. 17 was OOS so 21 it was! Picked up 5 shades of the new shine lipstick. Put a few other things in. Do I think it will ship? Nope. I fully expect a cancellation email :).,3
중립,"I needed to hear this! I just ordered 4 cushions and all the lippies: 4 rouge classy, 1 nude balm, and a nude gloss. For $70 Canadian!!!! Please let it ship 🙏",3
중립,Oh my! What is the normal price range for the lippies? Do you know if Hera is cruelty free?,3
중립,"Sadly, my Hera order for the cushion sets (#21 & 23) and lipstick was all cancelled today!  What about everyone else’s order?

Edited to add the color #s",3
중립,Fingers crossed for both of us! I was so bummed I just bought a new foundation so unfortunately didn't get a cushion.,3
중립,Fingers crossed!! 🤞🏽🤞🏽,2
긍정,"My order was cancelled too! Was too good to be true. 

Sad I couldn’t repurchase the black cushion. It’s too expensive normally so I’ll stick with clio

Edit to add: the sensual matte lip in lip morning wasn’t cancelled. So somehow they’re going to send me just the one $4 lippie in 3-4 weeks lol",2
중립,I just came here to say the same 😭 ,1
중립,"Hi! Was it cancelled yet? Or is it still going? If they cancel it, can you let me know?",1
중립,Did you end up ordering? Were you charged duties?,2
중립,"I ordered Innisfree products from Amore Mall for USD$67.15. I live in Toronto, and it took 4-5 days to be delivered, which is really fast but I paid CAD$32 for custom duties :(",2
긍정,"I have made a couple of orders. The shipping is extremely fast, within 5 days to Europe. The carrier in my country is DHL. I always have to pay VATs. But same as from OY. So no big deal. Anyway Amore Mall is better for me due to the not overloaded by products as OY is. So for me easy to choose. They also have very good deals for members. And I recieved a bunch of testers or minis products in every order even they werent advertised. For me Amore Mall deal nicely with their customers, good prices, very fast shipping, and bunch of gifts. In the last order (over 120USD) I got 7 kinds of sheet masks, 5 minis of creams and 7 mini testers of sunscreens👍",1
중립,"I am very curious to know if u ended up ordering, I want to as well",1
긍정,"Im from Vancouver Canada, I placed an order one day ago just to buy hera products as I found them to be cheaper at amoremall (also comes with nice free gifts). No shipping fee as my order was over 100$ CAD. 

Last night i got a notif from DHL that it will arrive 2 days from now. So it takes about 4-5 days to arrive. 

However i did receive another email from DHL this morning about custom fees 🤦🏻‍♀️ ended up paying about 37$ CAD.

So far, stylevana and yesstyle are the only websites that i dont have to pay custom fees. But olive young and amore mall does. I do think I’d still buy from both websites, as the price is cheaper for products that are expensive/not sold in other websites.",1
긍정,"Thank you! I hardly find anything related to someone purchasing off amoremall so this was very helpful. I never used to get charged customs for Olive Young but recently, been charged.",1
중립,"No worries! Actually the package ended up arriving just 2-3 hours after i wrote that 😅 i was a bit surprised at how fast the shipping was considering most of the other packages ive received would take around 2 weeks to arrive.

I do recommend ordering from there, especially if you’re looking to purchase hera products. They actually sent a hefty amount of free hera products and other items too. I was baffled when opening because i essentially only bought two products but  ended up getting around 15. Mix of samples, travel size, and full size. (But im a huge fan of anything mini. So when i saw they actually gave a mini hera cushion, i think it just took the spot light away from all the other products 😭 lol)",1
긍정,"I just purchased Missha and really love it. I actually found it on a rack at TJ Maxx and took it as a sign to try it, especially since it was still 9m from being OOD. Like you, I was so hesitant; feeling like it's hard to familiarize yourself in a sense? I don't know. I love kBeauty skin care but I am now a cushion believer too, thanks to Missha-! Btw, I have exactly same skin as you- down to controlled breakouts. :)",1

Jokes aside, thanks for the review OP. I had my eye on the Klairs one, but I'm rethinking it",70

긍정,I would love to try equalberry one since I havent tried it yet and its really purpely and also I love the mary&may one I tried many of their products for sureeee,5
긍정,"I've been spot testing the cream version of that Mary & May serum, and I suspect it has actually brightened that part of my face. It legitimately looks less red and whiter than the rest of my face? Hardly any fragrance and goes on really nicely. I'm so happy with it, I'm gonna start using it on the rest of my face",5
긍정,Mary&may serum seems like a good choice if I'd like to easy to use every day. Thanks for the review!,2
중립,[removed],1
긍정,I love all of hera’s products but the cost 😭 thanks for posting this now i want equalberry bakuchiol,1
중립,Would using the Equalberry one and another retinol be too much...? Did you use it during the night?,1
긍정,Cos de Baha serums are my favorite. Currently I use the azelaic acid one and the HB serum and both work really well. I have also use their vit c serum (the one with ascorbic acid) with nice results (I’m just choosing other actives over vit c right now).,1
중립,"I loved every product I’ve tried from Cos de Baha. But I have to say their 2.5 retinol has done more for my skin than any other product I’ve ever used. Completely cleared up melasma that nothing else could touch. And interestingly I wear a glucose monitor, high doses of vitamin c will cause it to give false lows. The Cos de Baha vitamin c is the only one I’ve used that showed up on my monitor. 

Now if I could only find them in stock somewhere, I’m assuming the tariffs have affected the supply, but I can’t even find it on the Asian sites.",1
긍정,"I really love the cos de baha azelaic acid. helped a lot with my redness and break out but if you're not having these problems, i don't think it would do much. still my HG tho since i break out a lot",1

긍정,I really liked the texture photos! I also love serums with a bouncy feel.,1
긍정,I love #5 Soonding calming serum for my acne-prone skin. It is so hydrating but also great for redness. I cannot use retinol products for irritation.,1
중립,I would recommend trying more budget friendly korean skincare products =),1
중립,HI OP! Did the Cos de Baha serum fade your darkspots or any pigmentation?,1

긍정,"Hard agree on #2. Been great for my redness/ rosacea and also pretty hydrating.
Would recommend.",0
긍정,Well its also hard finding the right serum till we try them all so I kinda feel it haha good to see all the list thank you op,9
긍정,"That Klairs serum is my HG for my rosacea and firming/well-aging

I'm on my second bottle. You use it first after cleansing on damp skin. I do 4 drops on sections of my face and rub it in. (It's too watery and wastes product to put it in your hands first)

It's amazing for me. I could tell a difference in about a week.",4
중립,Try the Klairs cream from the Midnight Blue line instead. It has the age-supporting benefits but also makes my skin feel so soft the next morning.,4
중립,"haha, same. I only started using serums last year. Klairs is really gentle and easy to use. Definitely a product that helped me. For moisture, you’ll have to use that serum along with another product.",3
중립,"I used this product when I was breaking out a lot, and I noticed it helped calm my skin down!",5
중립,"I also bought Equalberry after seeing it on reddit. The texture felt a bit weird at first, but the more I use it, the more I like it. Mary&may, I first tried their sheet masks and honestly every product I’ve used since has exceeded my expectations!",2

Here's custard mauve vs lilac cream. This is an old pic and I ended up destashing custard mauve because it would oxidize very warm and red on me after a few minutes compared to the fresh swatch to the right of it. Lilac cream doesn't tend to have this issue for me so it was kept, and is still one of my favorites.",10
중립,"I don’t have Lilac Cream or Murmur Pink in my collection, but I found some tiktok videos comparing swatches of the two shades. From what I’ve seen:

* **Lilac Cream**: muted mauve-pink with a lilac undertone, slightly cooler and softer than the others.
* **Murmur Pink**: brighter pink with a stronger rosy undertone, more vibrant than Lilac Cream.
* **Custard Mauve**: deeper rose-pink with hints of berry. In my eyes, compared to Lilac Cream and Murmur Pink in the swatches I watched, Custard Mauve is warmer and more intense, leaning closer to a vivid pink rather than a soft muted shade. 

In terms of formula and how they feel on the lips, I think they’re all the same since they’re from the Dewyful Water Tint line.

Here is the swatch photo from the TikTok comparison I watched:

긍정,"Thanks for the compliment! 😆.  I knew virtually nothing about j-beauty during my first trip, but I did the research for my second.  I learned a lot from Asian beauty YouTubers like Tina Tanaka Harris, Be Yo Best, and Beauty Within.  I was planning to buy all the Naturie products--toner, gel, and moisturizer, but I found I didn't really like the moisturizer.  It seemed to gelify and disappear after application, but I live somewhere really dry and I need a heavier moisturizer. C'est la vie.  ",2

긍정,"I LOVED shopping at all the different drug stores in Japan.  My favorites for skincare/beauty were Sundrug (they were slightly cheaper than everywhere else), Matsumoto Kiyoshi, Cocokara Fine, and Donki.  One thing I learned was that stores can have location-specific deals/discounts on items.  I got the Kose Clear turn illustrator packs at a random Sundrug location for 200 yen less than the typical price--I couldn't believe my eyes.  this discount was not available at other Sundrug locations.  So, long story short, shop around and pounce on a really good deal.",7

긍정,"Could be worse 🤷🏻‍♀️.  I brought home over 500 masks, spread across 35 separate packages. Now imagine if they were all individually wrapped.  35 < 500. 
I also bought quite a few refill packs which will eventually be put into reusable jars and bottles.  I'd say I did a pretty good job in the plastics department considering I was going to buy it all anyway. 😀",5

긍정,"In skincare, products can be categorized into hydrators and moisturizers.  Hydrators add water back into your skin while moisturizers (I believe) add fat/oil back into your skin and are great for ""sealing"" everything in.  The Naturie gel is a hydrator.  As for the Kikumasamune... It was in my must-buy list but it was completely sold out everywhere.  I had nearly given up when I found it at an Aeon Mall.  Bought it on the spot.  I probably won't open it anytime soon; gotta use up my open bottles first.

중립,"Everyone in my family go out to work + school every day. My drive to work typically takes 25 - 35 minutes depending on traffic/coffee run. No luxury of working from home 😢. I thought about having my car windows be UV tinted, but it won’t fully block UV rays and sunscreens use still needed. In Australia where you’re from, I’m aware that the sun is much, much worse.

Just me (idk about the rest of my family), I typically use up 1x 50ml tube every 3 weeks just on face and neck.
To most people, my family sunscreen usage might look excessive, borderline unfathomable; but, we’ve been through several carcinoma removal (MOHS) and topical chemotherapy for either basal, AK, and squamous - my belief is that it prompts us to religiously reapply, hoping our yearly skin checks wont come back with more surprise carcinoma. Such a cliche… get some form of skin cancer and become sunscreen fanatics.

My husband and I can’t take back the mistakes of our youth ignoring or under applying sunscreen while we camp, leisurely hike, bike, canoe or snowboard. We’re now wise enough to know better to make sunscreen use + UPF clothing a habit for us and our kids.",33
긍정,"My husband and kids don’t cut the tubes - I cut them and applied what’s left of their sunscreen on my body. For body, we use cheap, large size, waterproof non-AB (US) sunscreens atm that’s greasy as hell; but it doesn’t matter cuz we use it while on cruise vacation and doesn’t have to suffer cleaning up nasty US sunscreen grease on our vehicle seats or furniture/bedding.

I did buy a good amount of water resistant Japanese sunscreens, but it’s in pump bottle (220g size) and not very convenient to take traveling (might spill inside our luggage).",8
중립,"To answer your questions that I forgot on my first reply, I reapply very often during our cruise because we’re technically in middle of ocean with huge windows in most areas of the ship. Minimal shade. We’re often seated close to the windows during breakfast and lunch and I don’t want to risk my melasma coming back.

I did wear a facekini and Coolibar full UPF covered swimwear. My husband and kids isn’t keen on looking like the creature from Shape of Water so they just slather on non-AB (US) sunscreens. We could’ve brought our supplies of EU and AB formula water resistant body sunscreens that’s in a tube, but we’re saving it for the next time since it has expiration of 03/28 and De Minimis has just been repealed + MoCRA situation - thought it’s prudent to save its usage for now. We always go out and do stuff, so there’s always opportunities in the future to use up the better formulas.",12
중립,"Omi Verdio has the water resistant sunscreen in 220g pump bottle which is the very exact one I stocked up on. AB sunscreens typically only sold in standard of 50-100ml size because the society and culture have practiced sun protective as well as sun avoidance behavior, so any sunscreen more than 100ml is too much products and likely won’t sell well.

Until they died, I have never seen my grandparents go outside without sun umbrella. Growing up, I always wonder why my grandma kept her umbrella open even if it’s cloudy. She said just because the cloud is covering the sun, doesn’t mean the sun can’t reach you. Clouds are just like strainers, it still lets sun rays reach you.

My parents kept to indoor spaces away from windows during our cruise. They refused to do water activities or go on the pool area and bravely wear sun umbrellas during land excursions despite sticking out among the crowd of non-Asians because of the umbrella. They also wear sunscreens, hats, long sleeves rash guards, not for skin cancer fear, but for prevention of wrinkles and sun spots. At 70 and 73, my parent’s skin looks pretty healthy with minimal wrinkles. Growing up, I thought both my grandparents and parents sun protective behavior as embarrassing so I did opposite of them - but look who got some form of skin cancer now 😔",3

Any sunscreen now has to be exceptional for me to spend that kind of coins since I reapply every 2 hours and use significant amount. But if you’re mostly indoors, it’s worth it to try. I drive to work and my office has huge windows positioned where the sun shines directly into them. My desk is right next to the huge windows.",1

중립,"I can’t fully get rid of my melasma. If I look close enough in the mirror, I can still see the outline of it. It’s a lot better now. Also, I figured out that UV light triggers it so I use sunscreens and UPF clothings/hat/umbrella like my life depends on it. 

Every 3 months I go for appointment to see my dermatologist for follow up; some appointments are for melasma, others are skin cancer related. He prescribed either Triluma or Oral TXA or Tretinoin for Melasma, sometimes Cyspera if it’s just superficial darkening.",5
중립,not just the UV rays but it will make the inside of your car a lot cooler which is a game changer in the summer when you first get into your car,3

중립,"The purpose of the tone up sunscreen is to look a bit whiter, usually also with a pink undertone.  It also covers minor imperfections, hence rather casty as well.",119
중립,"They’re only beneficial for certain skin tones, unless your goal is to look paler (which tbf is what tone up creams were made for) 

I’m already really pale, so a tone up sunscreen just evens out my skin tone. I wear it by itself when I don’t feel like wearing makeup.",69
중립,"East Asians like to use Tone Up sunscreens as a primer before foundation/cushion/BB cream. The white cast is actually a desired effect to help even out and lighten skin tone prior to applying the next makeup step. Companies create different color tone ups depending on the wanted effect: green to cancel out redness, pink to brighten complexion, lavender for sallowness.",31
중립,"In Korea and Japan it's all about looking as white/pale as possible, as well in every other asian country since their obsession with fair skin goes to bounds. That's the hype and the idea behind tone up sun creams. 

In the West, white people want to be tanned. In Asia, people want to be fair. Basically everyone wants what they don't have or what is uncommon, it's the human psyche.",76
긍정,"I personally use them over regular sunscreen only for ""no-makeup"" makeup days or very minimal makeup days. It just provides very minimal skin evening. My skintone is on the paler end, so it's not too white/grey on me. It's just lighter than BBs, foundations, or concealer. I use the purple one by Decorte, unsure if I love it or not but it works for me.",27
중립,"Tone Up is for the super fair, or the person who doesn't want to be their actual skin tone lol I live in the US. I don't tan, I don't whiten. I just want to look like my head belongs on my neck and body lol",8
중립,"I’m a somewhat pale Asian with mild rosacea and use the green toneup sunscreen from Skin Aqua. YES there’s a deliberate white cast and a little shininess due to local market trends. I also have their latest blue version and the marketing for it says it gives you “marshmallow skin”. It is _very_ whitening on me and I do indeed get the marshmallow skin effect. I really wish their green formula included Cica and not just the blue one. 

I do find that the white cast fades on me after a while although not completely, and it does cover up my redness and imperfections pretty well. On a regular day I just use a bit of concealer on top of it if necessary and skip foundation or bb cream.",8
긍정,"I also did not have a good experience with tone up sunscreen (I tried the Manyo sun cream which is meant to be more beige I believe) but I realized it’s because I personally didn’t like the effect of it 

It’s common in Asian cultures to prefer fair skin and tone up sunscreens can help achieve that by brightening and oftentimes evening out the skin more 

I learned that I didnt want my skin lightened and I prefer my face to match my body so I gave it away 

It’s just a personal preference I think!",15
긍정,"Because that is what they are designed to do? I am super pale, and I love tone up sunscreens cause they help brighten and even my skin tone without foundation. They don't work for everyone but there's nothing wrong with that",13
중립,"That specific Hera Tone Up sunscreen has Amore Pacific proprietary ingredients Melasolv (Thymol Methoxycinnamate) and if you received the sample that expire 04/2028 onwards, it also contains UV-R Pro. I have melasma so anything that prevent pigment transfer and regulation of pigments is a reason for me to use that particular tone up underneath layered under sunscreen.

I also use other tone up sunscreen under foundations that oxidize and turn bronzy orange on me seeing the super chalk white-based cool-toned pink shade neutralize it.

Some of the tone up sunscreen have salmon pink shade that helps camouflage my melasma. It’s more color correcting purpose in this case.

Since we have to use 2-3 (4-5 if the spout is tiny or it’s fluid) finger length minimum on our face, I use just 1 finger length tone up sunscreen underneath followed by 2 finger length of my real sunscreen that typically has faint yellowish tint due to presence of UVA filters in the formula. This way, I make sure I use adequate amount for my face to be protected.

Edit: change the expiry year from 2027 to 2028 for correction.",6
긍정,"It's for people who are pale and with pink undertone and are happy to finally have something that matches our actual skin tones, not our freckles.

Definitely not for everyone. Yes it's like white cast, but applies more smoothly and blurs better.

I use Tirtirs beige for low-makeup days. On top of regular sunscreen. Tinted sunscreens are way too gray/orange on me, toneup looks fine. Neither tinted nor toneup should be applied in full sunscreen coverage amount, it's just a bit extra.",16
긍정,It is glorified white cast to me. I am somewhat pale but the ones I tried look ashy on me. I wouldn't wear tone up sunscreen unless I am going to put makeup over it especially if it is green or pink tinted. I am down for a good real tinted sunscreen though. I am waiting for asian sunscreens to hop onto that.,6
중립,I view it as like a tinted sunscreen or tinted moisturizer tbh. Especially if someone is as pale as I am lmfao,4
긍정,"This thread is making me realize I love tone up sunscreen so much because I am a ghostly pale person. Huh. 

That said, I have maybe 10 varieties of tone up sunscreens and they vary wildly in effect. Some are pinky-pale, some are beige, some are basically clear and the ‘cosmetic effect’ is either luminosity or a faint blurring. ‘Tone-up’ just seems to mean ‘sunscreen plus a cosmetic skin effect’ but what that effect is can vary wildly. 

My favorite ‘basically clear but gives a luminous look’ is Allie ‘bright showers’ beauty tone up. 

My favorite beige is Numbuz:n - No.3 Porcelain Base-skip Tone Up Beige (but again, I am unto a ghost so it’s probably still pale by a lot of people’s standards, just not pink/white)",9
중립,"There are different shades of tone up sunscreens, think of them as color correctors and sunscreen in one. There are green ones to counteract redness, purple ones to counter sallowness, pink and peach ones to brighten depending on skintone. Seems like you’re more suited for peach ones if the pink one is too pink on you. Finally, beige tinted ones are basically super light coverage base makeup, basically tinted moisturizer with SPF. 

Benefits to tone up is that other than making the skin look more even toned, like tinted sunscreens, they contain often iron oxides and can provide sun protection in the visible light range (blue and violet light etc).",3
중립,was thinking the same thing when i watched these tone-up sunscreen videos on tiktok 💀 my proud unpopular opinion is that it’s ridiculous,8
중립,"I do use one just for my neck though because my face, even without foundation, is lighter than my neck. (I think this was because I neglected to put sunscreen on my neck when I was younger). Btw, it's not just tone up sunscreens but toneup primer is also the rage now in Japan and Korea. So I have to use Western primers.",3
중립,"I'm very pale with mild rosacea and I've found that some of them actually tone down the redness, even if they're pink-toned. I don't like the formula of most of the ones I've tried, but the Canmake and Rovectin ones have been very comfortable on my skin even under light foundation. Sulwhasoo made one years ago that I got several samples of and absolutely loved. I saved it for special occasions because it made my skin look so glowy. It was too pricey for me to get the full size though. No idea if they still make it.",2
중립,"I think these are made with a specific skin tone/type in mind. I am a fair olive leaning cool, and I looove tone up sunscreens as they even out my redness and skin tone. Never had any look particularly pasty on me. But I totally understand why they wouldn’t be everyone’s cup of tea",2
중립,"I'm very pale so it blends into my face and neck well and makes me look like i have brighter clearer skin. there's also different shades of tone up. white, pink, green, purple. beige foundations never fit me but i never ask ""what's the hype?"" i just recognize it's not for me and let other people enjoy things.",4

긍정,"I think to look natural, they only work for a specific skin tone and if you’re warmer they appear grey. In Korea it’s not uncommon to go a few shades lighter for your face or use tone up cream all over to look ‘brighter’ (paler). I tried the Peripera one out and I have a cooler undertone with pale skin so it just evens it out naturally without looking like I have makeup on but I add bronzer if I’m doing a natural makeup look. I don’t think I’d repurchase as sunscreen works for me but it’s been interesting to try. I apply it to my neck too.

I had samples of two tone up sunscreens (peripera is more of a base) and they were chalky and gave me a white cast and didn’t look or feel nice.",1

I still don't care for them and would not repurchase, but at least I won't be wasting my money.",1
중립,"Well.. i’m pale. Tone up act like sheet foundation for me. I don’t use foundation separately most of the time. Convenient.

A lot of more northern Asians (and that absolutely does include some Koreans, Japanese and Chinese) are naturally Fitzpatrick I, same as northern Europeans. Obviosly, not all of them, but it's long past time pretending that asians are only pale if they 'chase whiteness'.

PSA: this influencer is actually not quite pale enough to be perfect match for the product (despite the light), but she shows amount and application very well.

It's transferproof, sheer coverage, but covers imperfections (like redness, undereye darkness) WAY better than coverage level would suggest. Blurs out beautifully, streakfree IF you apply it with fingers and let it dry before dragging brush over it. Sheer enough it's unable to settle in any creases. Dewy finish, doesn't attempt to be matte. Real SPF in combo with this is a must, this  is just a topup with like 5..10 SPF points in actual use. Great base for blushes/eyeshadows etc to meld into.

Be warned - it's a strongly perfumed product.  Not just 'aww it has some scent', but proper fantasy accord of  some airy clean soap/florals (maybe slightly fruity florals) situation in terms of notes. My best guess is that it's meant to evoke an idea of 'peach blossom'. 'Sakura' (the fantasy idea of it) would be similar territory.",3
중립,"I like the Skin Aqua Tone Up Essence. They have a few different tones you can pick from. I’ve only tried the mint one since I have some redness.

As for preference between Turnover and Dual Effect, I use them both. Say, I finish a bottle of Dual Effect, then I crack open a new Turnover ampoule to use. My goal is to extend the result of my Rejuran injectable until I have time to travel to Korea again to re-up the injectable. I find both equally hydrating. As for skin results, be reminded that I have received the injectable form prior to using both ampoules, so if you’re planning to use it without having received injectables then it’s YMMV territory.",2
중립,Thanks for replying! I find it very lightweight but I don’t have a mustache :),1
부정,I agree with you that it’s lightweight so I repurchased (I used it before couple years ago to try but found other sunscreens I personally like more) it for him thinking it’s baby sunscreen so must not be too bad for facial hairs. At least I got him variety of sunscreens to try and find one that wont leave film and residue on facial hair. The same sunscreen also left residue on my husband facial hair with exception of the Haru Haru Black Rice Airy fit which my husband likes and hopefully my son will try the tube I got for him soon.,2
중립,"My daughter HATES most lotions, creams, gels… pretty much any product on her skin. Getting her to apply sunscreen is a battle only won when she goes swimming. I am hopeful she will be more open to skincare as she gets older (she’s 11). I am taking note of your rec’s if this time comes!",2
중립,"My kids, especially my son hates skincare and sunscreen but he changed his mind and open to proactively wear sunscreens when he saw both my husband and I were home from the MOHS surgeon with surgical wounds from Basal Cell Carcinoma (me) and Actinic Keratosis (my husband). He saw my husband skin erupts and peppered with weeping pus from prescription topical chemo medication killing off precancerous skin cells. Now everyone in my family gets into the program of daily sunscreens and reapplying them.

Once they get into the routine, our next step is buying them various sunscreens for them to find the ones they like. We have a few that they don’t like or simply ambivalent with, but they have gotten into habit of using sunscreen so they used it on their body to finish it (not wasting and leaving the sunscreen to expire because they don’t like it) and move to try another. It’s opportune time because I have been hoarding sunscreens since last November and now my kids have started trying them out for  months now.

Once all the sunscreens and tariffs situations are more certain in nature, they would’ve found a couple of sunscreens that they like to wear to rotate so they ain’t bored.",2

I AM SO EXCITED. Is it out already? Will Olive young ship it to me? 🤩🤩🤩

Edit: NVM I reread everything and it seems like it’s not the new filter we’re waiting for, but something else- antioxidants to reverse some of the long range UVA damage after they get to the skin, not a filter that blocks it from reaching the skin.",1
중립,"According to the Korean Amoremall, the official brand Naver store, and department store websites, the current version has the same ingredient list as the one launched in February 2023 (not to be confused with the June 2022 version, which contained fragrance).

Since it wasn’t formally announced as a reformulation but simply updated in April to include UV-R PRO in the product description, it makes me think the technology has been in development for some time and is only now being announced.

In their press release, they said the technology had already been developed and they ""only"" used BASF's Radical Skin Protection Factor (RSF) to evaluate the effectiveness of UV-R PRO in products formulated with the technology so it's perfectly plausible that the February 2023 version of Hera's Tone-Up sunscreen was already formulated with it. At the time it was quietly relaunched with a new formula and no one really understood why.

Since April, the product description has been updated to reflect the BASF test results and it now says the sunscreen provides a Photoaging Defence Index of 70+.",1

I also thought of importing it but I fear running the risk of getting an older formulation. I have ordered products that had a recent reformulation only to recieve the older formulation, though not expired. This has happened to me on 4 different ocassions lol

중립,Yeah I wonder how you can tell which version is being sold??,1
중립,"In the product description of the sunscreen they wrote:

""The technology provides even more effective protection against photoaging by neutralising the oxidative stress caused by deeply penetrating UVA rays.""

But they haven’t disclosed any specific details. I suspect the technology might still be undergoing patent approval, which would explain the lack of transparency for now.

I ran a comparison between the ingredient list of the version launched in 2022 and the 2023 reformulation and the only new addition in 2023 was Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, not exactly an antioxidant.

So I'm inclined to believe the technology was already used in the  2022 version. 

Out of sheer curiosity, I compared the ingredient list of the 2022 formula with the one launched in 2019, and here are the ingredients that were added at that point:

3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid  
Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer  
Aluminum Hydroxide  
Arginine  
BHT  
Biotin  
Calcium Chloride  
Cetearyl Alcohol  
Citric Acid  
Dextrin  
Dibutyl Adipate  
Fucose  
Glucose  
Glyceryl Caprylate  
Histidine  
Hydrogenated Lecithin  
Lauric Acid  
Lysine  
Magnesium Chloride  
Mannose  
Methyl Trimethicone  
Myristic Acid  
Niacinamide  
Palmitic Acid  
Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate  
Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate  
Polymethyl Methacrylate  
Potassium Chloride  
Potassium Phosphate  
Potassium Sorbate  
Silica  
Sodium Chloride  
Sodium Citrate  
Sodium Dehydroacetate  
Sodium Phosphate  
Thymol Trimethoxycinnamate  
Triethoxycaprylylsilane  
Tromethamine  
Xylose  

There’s a mix of film formers, texture enhancers, amino acids, and a few antioxidants like 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, BHT, and Niacinamide. So it’s possible the “antioxidant technology” refers to a combination of these, but that’s just speculation at this point.",1

The skin aqua It corrects my redness and blurs my pores just enough. I also like numbuzin tone up no.3 if i wanted a bit more coverage. These 2 are my favs for now, haven’t found others suitable for me so far.",16
긍정,"The Anessa purple tone up gel is nice, I also like the Roundlab tone up spf. The numbuzin one is also good if you want more of a beige skin tint look.",9
중립,"i use **anessa tone up** for day-to-day and **allie tone up** for special occasions bc it provides heavier/longer tone-up coverage (also bc it costs more and the bottle is so small 😭) i use purple to counter the green/olive in my face.


i use to use skin aqua tone up as my daily but it doesn’t dry as matte as anessa does. i do miss skin aqua’s thinness tho, it feels like youre putting on nothing. anessa does have some “feel” to it on the face but i have oily skin so i prefer anessa’s matte finish.",8
중립,"This Q was meant for me. Buckle down. I won’t review the Hera and the dalba since OP says she’s already tried it. 

1. Ahc aura secret tone up cream- pinky, provides glow and a natural tone up. Medium texture. 

2. Espoir water splash spf/ pinky tone, also glowy and provides tone up. But more dewy than the ahc imo. Thicker texture. 

3. Ckd all covery sun spf- this has a beige tone and is tone up for ppl who use 22 or darker. This didn’t tone up much for me. Medium texture. 

4. Manyo factory foundation free sun cream- also beige in tone. Tones up a LOT. And I use shade 21 normally. This has the most coverage out of all the tone up spf here. Thicker texture, needs to be rubbed in. 

5. Missha sulbon tone up sunscreen- pinky tone, also slightly glowy. Blends well. 

6. Tocobo vita tone up spf- watery, near white in color. Tones up well. Slightly more drying than the other spf, not thick at all. 

7. Cnp tone up protection sun/ thick, pink colored, provides good protection. But the pink tone didn’t last past six hours. 

8. Numbuzin porcelain base tone up- horrible product. Got all over my pores. Disappeared patchily. I gave this away. Could not finish. 

9. Cell fusion c toning spf- medium texture, pink, tone up lasts longer and slightly dryer texture. I could only use in spring summer. 

10. Dewytree anti pollution spf- white color tone up. It’s mineral spf. Quite drying, tone up isn’t super pale but it does last. ",10

Its a peach tone though, I feel like like those suit me better than pink ones though I’ve only ever tried the romand tone up sunscreen and that was hella pasty lol.

중립,"Skin Aqua Tone Up UV Essence (the lavender one) is my fave, it has a slight purple tint that cancels out dullness and works surprisingly well on pale skin without looking weird.",1
긍정,"I also use the Numbuzin no. 3 tone-up. It's amazing! It's a light beige, no pinkiness, so it gives a really good brightening effect that doesn't make pinkish cool toned skin even pinker. And it doesn't make it yellower or darker either, like some tinted moisturizers can do (Estee Lauder, I'm looking at you!). It actually brightens and evens out the my skin tone, and doesnt stamp/rub off with that foundation-y browny color on my phone or when I blow my nose. 100/10.",1

긍정,"Anyone disappointed with the D’Alba tone up reformulation? It’s been my ride or die for the past few years (gone through at least 10 of them) because it was perfect for my dry, super pale, and cool-toned skin and it never once cause a problem for my skin. It also played well with other products and worked amazingly as a makeup primer. However, I finally ran out of my stock of it recently and ordered some on Amazon so I could get it more quickly. This new bottle is soooo much different. The tone up is not as pink, it isn’t as nicely moisturizing, it smells different, etc. I thought I got a fake product until I noticed the bottle was different and did a bit of poking around online and saw that it had been reformulated for sale in the US. Does anyone know if I order from sites like Yesstyle if I would get the original formula or the US formula? 

Also, I have tried other tone ups but didn’t like them that much in comparison to the D’Alba. I’ve tried Numbuzin and find it drying. I liked one of the old Skin Aqua ones that was in a light pink plastic bottle, but I think they stopped making it because I haven’t been able to find it in years now. The new Skin Aqua is way too scented for me compared to the old one. 

Definitely following this post and checking some out on this list.",1

긍정,"Honestly, I don't suggest using the aqua tone up sunscreen, especially if your skin is sensitive. It dries out my skin a lot, and when I put it on, I get a burning, hot sensation. If you wanna buy a tone up sunscreen, try the one from romand, judydoll and skin1004. They're amazing!",1

only downsides are a tiny bit of fragrance and noticeable alcohol (it’s very cool to the touch) so it may not be for everyone :(

I compared it to the tirtir green toneup essence and I feel like I prefer to skin aqua one. it’s cheaper overall, sweat resistant as well, and I just couldn’t deal with how runny and fragrant the tirtir one was even though the green essence was more pigmented and offered a more neutralising effect.",14

부정,"Honestly, I did this because my daughter said I’m turning into a trash hoarder. She told me to post on Reddit for memory then throw all of it out. I kept collecting the empties because History of Whoo free mini samples packaging are so darn cute! 

Also, I miss SK and yearn to return once I am confident the airport in my state is back to being safe and functional again. Shopping at SK department store beauty counters extremely memorable experience for me. Every time I buy a set, the employee added more and more free samples of minis and sheet masks from other range of the same brand. Seeing her visually tossing freebies into my shopping bag is one of the biggest dopamine hit I had 😂

My kids are at stage of finding skincare they like so they had me buying bunch of products for them. I’m grateful that so far none of the stuff I got them are complete bust aka it’s so bad they can’t/won’t use it. They empty it and move on to whatever next in their stash.

I started collecting empties again after this post because we’re starting our family no-buy for roughly the next 4 years having hoarded massive quantities of AB products back in Nov ‘24.

Not sure about the COL where you live but I order my backup Stylevana on Oct ‘24, that’s the price then which I find quite reasonable and competitive with other brands for c-PDRN products. With tariffs, presently Stylevana has increased the price for US consumers.

I placed another order for it from Ballagrio (SK based online retailer) April of this year not long after Mango Mussolini announced his “Liberation Day tariffs”. Price is couple dollars more but back then I can’t order from Stylevana because of the 145% tariffs since Stylevana ship from HK.

If you live outside of US, perhaps Stylevana website will show different price for you and might be cheaper.",2

This is how much I paid for my Rejuran backups from Ballagrio. As you see some items are couple dollars more expensive compared to Stylevana price in Oct 2024.

To gauge whether anything is expensive it all depends on the strength of currency and COL. Rejuran injectables currently cheapest in Thailand because all the SK clinics in Gangnam jacked up the prices for tourists.",1

Since neither of us gone to Japan since his last trip in 2022 and had used up all 20x tubes, I had to pay the premium and buy it from middlemen websites like Japanese Taste and With Love Japan before De Minimis ended. It’s like $30++ for a tube but I waited for their sale season and got it 15% off. Now, our best bet once we used up our hoard is to fly to Japan and buy directly there.",1

¥2250 base price (just for the 135g size toothpaste) + 10% Japan consumption tax + flat delivery fee guaranteed same day delivery around Minato-Ku area ¥1000. 

He ordered A LOT (20 tubes Apagard Royal toothpaste, 10 bottles Apagard deep care mouthwash) and it’s way above 2kg so the manufacturer opted for flat shipping cost instead of weight.",1

Jung Saem Mool Skin Nuder is worth 👏 every 👏 cent 👏 

When I tell you I have never before had a foundation look that good on me, even on my dry and flaky patches 😭 Every time I apply it, I'm amazed all over again at how pretty it looks (this is starting to sound like an ad, lol) 

My undertone is neutral, so I've been using the shade Fair-Light, but I want to try Fair-Pink as well, simply because I prefer a slightly cooler undertone with my red hair.

Romand Nu Zero is my second favourite, but I'm more into glowy foundations these days. Might try the Bare Water version some day.",5
긍정,Make over for all powerstay sync matte cushion(indo brand). Great shade range and it stays on despite the heat and humidity of Singapore.,2
중립,"I second the Jung Saenz Mool Skin Nuder cushion! It honestly deserves the hype. I have normal (not oily or dry), neutral skin tone and I use the shade medium and it’s a really close match. It gives a beautiful natural, but glowly finish. 

My only complaint is that after several hours, it starts to feel a bit heavy on my face.",1
긍정,"My personal favorite is the Rom&nd Bare Water Cushion. I’m fair, oily/combo, sunburn and tan, and very unpredictable climate. I’m in love with it, mostly because it’s both a summer and winter shade for me. Shade in question is 02 pure21. ",1
중립,what's your opinion on romand nu zero compared to jsm? is it more drying or flaky?,1
긍정,"Although I’m a dry skin girlie in SEA climate, true with the JSM cushion!

It’s the best cushion I’ve tried so far (and the priciest)",1
긍정,"In my experience, every cushion foundation needs some good skin prep beforehand.

That being said, I wouldn't say Nu Zero was more drying per se, but it was more matt looking compared to JSM (even though they advertise it as semi-matt). It controls oil better than JSM, but not enough for a truly oily type. On the other hand, it's not as drying as other matt foundations, so it will handle dry patches just fine, but won't blend them in entirely. The shades are very bright, lively and pretty. Imo, it's most suitable for normal and combination-oily skin type. 

JSM, on the other hand, doesn't control oil well, but gives your skin a pretty sheen and bluring effect upon first application. The colors are slightly more dull than Nu Zero, but it covers dry patches crazy well. Most suitable for dry and combination-dehydrated skin.",2
부정,"I've tried both and really liked JSM but not the Romand Nu Zero one.

The JSM one lasts better on my skin and looks natural. It's not drying or too dewy.

The Romand one looked bad and broke down after 5 hours. I don't think it was drying but looked dry? I ended up just chucking it out.",1
긍정,"I love both but personally love Nu Zero a bit more for my very oily skin. I use Geek and Gorgeous Vitamin C and Skin1004 Hylu Cica Sunscreen as skin prep in the daytime and Nu Zero stays on all day, no separation at all (its like a layer on top of my skin in a good way, oil just comes trough and can be blotted off but the foundation is undisturbed). Also I feel like it covers my pores better. JSM ist better on a less oily base, for example on a night out, when I don't wear sunscreen underneath - with sunscreens it kinda slips off for me. But the it is beautiful.",1
긍정,I love the Hera Aquabolic line! But I think they’ve developed it into a new line called Hera Hydro Reflecting line,1

중립,How do you like the Hera cushion?,3
중립,Curious about the concealers,1
중립,Im using Acnon cream from the pharmacy so well too! I hope it fits you as well,1
긍정,I haven’t used it for long but i think it’s pretty good so far. It’s a hybrid sunscreen so it does take longer to rub in otherwise it will leave a white cast. I’m shade 21-23 in kbeauty so it might leave a slight white cast on people with darker skin tones. It also has some fragrance but it doesn’t irritate my skin or give me a headache.,2
중립,"I quite like the Hera cushion, it gives a semi matte finish but it’s not drying nor does it cling onto my dry spots. However, it doesn’t have a blurring effect so it will look like u have makeup on.",1

I was looking for comparisons of some cushions in this shade range (my best cushion match to date is the Clio #2-BP Lingerie) - usually I prefer liquid foundations.",4

So real. Hera Black is my HG (along with Fwee Glass but I may eye the Hera Glow when I look at my next cushion to try out since I have the older version and didn’t like it but maybe this new one I will like (I’m delulu fr)). I’ve always eyed the JSM so very useful to read a side-by-side comparison. Always nice to see another cushion enthusiast (I’ve personally been eyeing the Parnell one since I’ve heard it’s popular in Korea). Thanks for the review! ",1
긍정,"Very insightful post! I also tend to flush easily and was looking into the Clio kill cover mesh glow cushion. I was just wondering if the product separates or cracks when your cheeks get heated, and if it has good coverage for redness?",1
중립,Do you know if the cushion refills fit into cases other than their own? I have the jungsaemmool cushion case and want to try the hera black but I'd rather buy just the refill if possible ToT,1

Hera and JSM are both so great--too bad they're so pricy 😭 but I guess it's worth it!",3

I think Hera and JSM both carry liquid foundations in bottles as well if you're interested in looking into those :) I was potentially going to grab one next time Olive Young has a sale since they last way longer than cushions.",2
긍정,Oh 100%! I originally bought the cushion because I heard such great things only for it to not work on my skin at all...definitely ymmv for every product out there ☺️ I'm so glad that it works so fantastic for you. It's always great to find that one cushion your skin is in love with!,1
긍정,The product unfortunately does separate a little when my cheeks get heated and dry...but the coverage is pretty good and layerable!,1
중립,Hi i was just wondering did you ever find this out?,1
중립,"I ended up buying a mini bottle of Clio’s Kill Cover Founwear (matte liquid) in #2 - Lingerie, and also tracked down some sample sachets of Hera’s Silky Stay foundation in shade 21C1 online. I’m keen to try 17C1 also.

Unfortunately it doesn’t seem like Hera Black Foundation liquid (in the black bottle) is available online anymore. Will see if I can track down JSM, I’m in Australia and our local k-beauty/j-beauty stores only carry a limited shade range of cushions (usually we only get the 17N in stores if the shade range goes as light as 17…most brands do have a 21 though.)",1
중립,"Laneige and Clio are expanding their ranges ,hopefully more brands do this!",2
중립,"Tirtir, clio, milktouch, unleashia and Parnell. I just know about these brands",2

긍정,"I didn't like the Judydoll iron rod mascara when I first tried it. Like you, I thought it was too natural of a look and my HG ride or die is the Clio Kill Lash in Long Curling so I was used to that level of curl, length and volume (I can get it to look pretty dramatic which is awesome). So I just left the Judydoll in my drawer and didn't think about it for a bit. Then I took it out again and figured out how to make it work. Basically I need like 2-3 coats of it for it to look good! It means dipping the iron wand back in a few times to really coat the lashes, but once I figured that out, I like it a lot more now!

중립,"You can definitely build up the Judydoll so it can be more natural or dramatic based on the number of coats. Clio has more lengthening and volumizing power, holds a curl fantastically and does not smudge. Judydoll doesn't volumize much, but can do a decent amount of lengthening if you do 2+ coats, holds a curl well enough and also doesn't smudge (that I've noticed). Plus you know Clio has an actual brush and Judydoll is the rod. I don't feel comfortable posting photos but you can def look them up online!

It’s too drying for me in the winter but I live in the American southeast and the summers are super hot and humid and this one has held up the best for me.

I have combo skin - oily tea zone, dry cheeks, and prone to little dry patches between my eyebrows",3
중립,"tir tir is super moisturizing with great coverage, and it makes me look dewy for some reason. some people say it oxidizes bad, but it comes in a mini size, so worth a try",3
중립,I think I have dry/combo skin (+eczema near the lips and nose area) and I feel like laneige’s pink cushion and the silver tirtir cushions holds well in a tropical summer weather (Indonesia). Though it does give me dry patches around areas where I have dry acne scars by the end of the day of wearing it. Innisfree’s matte no sebum cushion however dried me out :/,2
긍정,"i use the laneige pink cushion (glowy finish) and live in tropical climate like u described (Malaysia) and it's not oily at all! my skin is on the dryer side, but idt i have dry patches? so i don't know if it'd look with them, but the cushion is really nice. ive gotten one too many compliments about my skin (they think i'm not wearing anything)",2
긍정,"I cannot recommend Espoir be velvet cushion enough! I can't use it in europe because it's too matte for me, but it's PERFECT for asian heat/humidity in summer. It has a nice medium coverage, and with espoir I think a little goes a long way, so one cushion lasts forever.

If you want your cushion to stay on forever, I can also recommend spraying your face with A LOT of setting spray after you put on cushion (I ADORE Kose's Make Keep Mist) and then pat it down with the Puff. This way my make up stayed on all day and sometimes even all night",2
긍정,"Do you have the MAC Lip Prep + Prime? If I remember correctly, someone said a MAC MUA use it on their models' (?) undereyes too to avoid creasing. Maybe you can try that with the Clio?

긍정,"ive been using the jsm cushion! i use setting spray ofc which helps it last extra long but i really like the jsm because it works in different climates for me, even colder drier places like california. i will say, nothing is FULLY sweatproof but the jsm is my best overall pick!",1
중립,I haven’t noticed that! My cheeks are drier and T zone oilier. I use Haruharu sunscreen under western “grippy” primer before the cushion and I don’t use a lot. It’s like medium coverage id say,4
중립,"I set with setting powder and setting spray, so there's no transfer. If I'm wearing it to a full day of office work, I have to use a blotting paper during lunch to remove the oil. It doesn't get too shiny for me.

I recommend layering your toners and hydrating products, and using toner pads before application though, but my skin could need it more because I have dry/combo skin.

However, I did find that after a year of using it, it's starting to have a bit of separation after applying sometimes. Could be due to incorrect application, or changing skin types, or I just didn't layer enough hydrating products before application.

Edit: Some influencers made YouTube videos on the correct method of application, which is to press down and swipe then tap remaining product. Haven't tried it yet.",3
긍정,"I’ve tried the red tirtir cushion and liked the formula but it just oxidized way too yellow for my cool undertone. That was before they massively expanded their shade range, though! Except for the oxidization, it was a great formula even in the summer and, if you don’t have the oily tzone I work with, even the JSM might work for you. It’s such a great cushion",2

긍정,"🎀 LIPS I 🎀

🌸 **hera sensual nude gloss ; lingerie** 4/5 ([swatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/swatchitforme/comments/11onqdk/my_soft_peach_mlbbs/))

a beautiful lush formula that hugs the lips well with a glossy candy glaze without feeling sticky, it lasts well for a gloss and has a light minty cooling. the prettiest warm pinked peach with a hint of coral that’s sweet and youthful yet has some mute beige undertones. i love it for my warmer-toned looks. no stain.

🌸 **flower knows strawberry cupid lip cake ; pineberry** 4/5 ([swatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1i20may/flower_knows_strawberry_cupid_collection_swatch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

adorable packaging. a soft whipped cream mousse type formula with a blurry velvet finish, in the prettiest princess petal pink with strawberry milk undertones. also works beautifully as blush.

🌸 **etude velvet lips talk ; kinda nude & mood up** 4.5/5

technically mostly discontinued but i have to say this: this is my favourite powder-matte velvet lipstick formula ever over far more expensive formulas and i will never ever forgive etude house for taking them away from me.

🌸 **rom&nd lip mate pencil ; dove pink** 3.5/5 ([swatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1hjfby6/my_little_romnd_lip_haul_decoration_swatch_review/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

a soft lipstick-type formula rather than a typical dry lip pencil, so it probably doesn’t last as well, but it glides smoothly and is easy to blend. quite pigmented, a soft gentle strawberry milk beige pink similar to cooling up but a little more beige and white-based.

🌸 **rom&nd melting balm ; love pink & peonies & veiled rose** 4.5/5 ([swatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1hjfby6/my_little_romnd_lip_haul_decoration_swatch_review/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

i adore these. a thicker melting gel balm formula more than a thin slippery oil formula (like ysl rouge voluptes or chanel coco flashes), these hug the lips beautifully, adhering evenly without being sticky and building to decadent glossiness and good pigmentation with a gorgeously translucent watery depth. they last surprisingly well and smell like sugar-glazed fruit candy. in them, lips look lusciously full and cheeks dewy juicy. i don’t find them messy, melty, or hard to wind at all; though i will say, i go through them quite fast… i don’t get the complaints people make about them, but ymmv. love pink and peonies are beautiful candy pinks, with love pink being slightly more muted and neutral while peonies is a little lighter, brighter, and cooler; veiled rose is a lovely and very natural mlbb beige pink with a mauve purple undertone.",31
긍정,"🎀 SHADING 🎀

🌸 **hince dimension radiance balm ; clear** 4.5/5 ([swatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1h8z5uk/my_tanghulu_skin_holy_grail_the_hince_true/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

glass skin in a stick, can be built from subtle dewiness to a kiss by a glistening water nymph to a tanghulu glaze. this shade is clear, meaning there are no pigment or shimmer particles in it at all and it is transparent like a clear lacquer, which is why it has such a clear pure glassy effect. versatile, lasts beautifully, comfortable on the skin and non-sticky, and personally, does not disturb my base at all. i recommend warming it up on your fingers before applying. gets so many compliments.

🌸 **flower knows strawberry cupid all day glow liquid contour ; cold brew coffee** 4/5 ([swatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1i20may/flower_knows_strawberry_cupid_collection_swatch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

has a bit of a learning curve (or perhaps im just biased as im not a fan of liquids); it is very light and fluid, and takes a minute to set, so it blends away quickly if you blend too soon or much, but once you get the hang of it, it blends perfectly and lasts all day. a little goes a long way, it’s fairly pigmented, and the *perfect* desaturated cool slightly milky grey-brown for cooler light skintones. has a natural skin-like translucent satin-matte finish.

🌸 **flower knows butterfly cloud collar shading palette ; moon shadow & tawny tea** 4.5/5 ([swatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1gspn9s/flower_knows_butterfly_cloud_collar_collection/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

these are actual perfection, all-in-one sculpting palettes that each have 1 shimmer highlight, 1 matte highlight, 1 nose contour, and 1 face contour. the shimmer is a more natural soft shimmer, similar to mac double gleam but not as excellent, but still a pretty good highlight. the mattes are heavenly. perfect pigment, perfect blending, perfect lasting power, and most importantly perfect shades. imo tawny tea is great for neutral to neutral-warm skin (i have neutral-cool skin, it works for my neutral-warm makeup looks) and moon shadow is great for desaturated muted cool skin.",27
긍정,"🎀 EYE 🎀

🌸 **etude curl fix mascara ; black** 4.5/5

an excellent mascara for that dainty fairy look. it gives nice length and some volume, nothing crazy, but defines the lashes beautifully with that delicate wispy babydoll effect. also, the curl fix power is insane. it literally perms your curl in place and has lasted me >15h in tropical weather. sometimes after i’ve thoroughly removed it my lashes stay curled through the night. the formula is on the drier side - light on the lashes, with a thinner wand to catch all your upper and lower lashes without smudging. sometimes i like to use this as a base mascara for fixing and definition, and layer another mascara on top for more volume or length.

🌸 **flower knows butterfly cloud collar mascara ; chestnut brown** 4/5

another one for dainty lashes, this is a slightly wetter formula with a bit more length to it, and it delicately defines and gathers lashes in light manhwa clusters. very pretty and user-friendly. its dark brown is softer than black but dark enough to give the eyes good definition and i enjoy layering it on top of the etude one.

🌸 **clio kill liquid eyeliner ; kill black & kill brown** 4/5

smooth, opaque, great control, and it can give a beautiful ultra fine flick while also staying well on the lashline, and they last me quite a while. they’re not too wet and don’t bleed. the black is perfect jet black, the brown is a little light and warm for my preferences.

🌸 **merzy last gel eyeliner ; black moon & dutch brown** 4.5/5

oh i love these. very creamy and smooth and pigmented, they never skip or drag or fail me like many gel liners do. they can give a very clean line or smudge into a sultry smoky liner, and can be flicked into a shockingly fine wing. that said, they might not work well for those with oily lids. the black is perfect jet black, the brown is a beautiful perfect dark bitter cocoa brown.",22
긍정,"🎀 EYESHADOW 🎀

🌸 **holika holika fav piece single shadow ; espresso brown** 5/5

thank you to the redditor who recommended this to me – i can see why this is a korean MUA cult favourite. it is the *perfect* eyeshadow for shadow liner, naturally defining the lower lashline, and smoky eyes - i always get compliments when i use this as my sole product for smoky liner. great long-lasting formula, easy to use, and the perfect dark bitter cocoa brown – softer than a straight ash black but dark, muted and cool enough to work for cool-toned looks too. holy grail material.

🌸 **3CE eyeshadow palette ; some def \[ remix \]** 4/5 ([swatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeupflatlays/comments/15j2bpk/my_perfect_neutral_palette_for_my_light/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

i swapped a few shades from my old beach muse in, making this my staple neutrals palette - a cream matte for matte highlight and aegyosal, cream milk tea matte for neutral/warm eye looks, lavender milk tea matte for cool/pink looks, a neutral taupe and dusky brown matte for shading, rose brown matte for blush, iridescent sparkly pink topper, and a lush rose gold sparkle. such user-friendly and beautiful formulas. if only it had a dark brown liner shade and cream shimmer highlight, this would be my perfect palette.

🌸 custom palette with depotted singles from **rom&nd light & glitter garden eyeshadow palette** ([swatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/swatchitforme/comments/14nzvt1/romnd_better_than_eyes_palette_00_light_glitter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

i depotted in all my favourites from light & glitter garden and they’re gorgeous. you can tell these glitters are for east asian eyes - the way they just scintillate and sparkle in the most delicate yet brilliant and dimensional way. perfect as toppers, for layering, or over bare lids for a glimmering constellation. be warned, some shades have PET glitter.

also rip to the discontinued **peripera twinkle sugar liquid glitters**. better than stila.",23
긍정,"🎀 BLUSH 🎀

🌸 **dasique blush palette ; strawberry smoothie** 3.5/5 ([swatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1hz24sd/dasique_blush_palette_in_berry_smoothie_other/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

a quad of matte blushes ranging from pastel to candy pink. all 4 shades have prominent white base and slight cool blue undertones (they may pull more neutral if you have a yellow skintone to cancel out the blue tones). the top layer is very firmly pressed, but once broken through the formula is softer and more pigmented though the overall pigmentation is soft. it’s smooth and blendable without being powdery even with layering. on my skintone, the lightest shade is a highlighting shade, the second is a soft blush shade, and the last two are point blushes. i prefer more neutral pinks (and a little more opacity), but it’s a very cute quad.

🌸 **etude cookie blush ; grapefruit jelly** 5/5 ([swatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeupflatlays/comments/1hz2dt7/tiny_blush_collection/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))

my holy grail for years, this is my perfect neutral candy pink that’s sweet yet delicate, bubbly yet fresh - it has that clear transparent syrup effect despite having slight white base that harmonises it perfectly to my skintone. dainty marshmallow matte finish that builds and blends beautifully and has earned me so many compliments. perfection. my favourite blush. also the little coquette packaging is so cute.",38
긍정,"🎀 BASE 🎀

🌸 **clio glow mesh cushion ; lingerie** 3.5/5

lightweight, hydrating, a prettily dewy finish but in a superficially wet way rather than hydrated radiance which can look greasy and it impacts its adherence to skin. i recommend blending on the back of the puff lid first – applying like so in thin layers helps it not only adhere and blend smoothly, but reduces transfer and helps it last long with minimal fading. because it takes some technique for perfect results, it’s not my fav tho i do like it. also, the mesh can leak if not stored flat, not ideal for a portable cushion.

🌸 **clio new founwear cushion ; lingerie** 4.5/5

i adore this! applied thinly, it fixes beautifully – feels like nothing on the skin, looks very skin-like and lightly blurring, zero transfer, and lasts >12h with very minimal, elegant fading, no setting or touch ups required. it allows your skin’s natural radiance to glow through without looking shiny and puffy, giving a subtle sculpt. the glow mesh cushion is better for dry skin, but if your natural skin is good, this is imo a perfect cushion. love.

🌸 **flower knows swan ballet music box powder ; pink pearl snowflake** 4/5

firstly, the packaging is a dream. you *will* feel like a long lost swan princess as you powder your face with the pillowy little beribboned puff. the mesh allows you to get a very light even amount of powder that’ll softly set your makeup all day without looking too flat - a subtle, softly radiant type of natural matte. the powder’s pink tint is very sheer, with a faint cherry blossom fragrance that doesn’t linger. you can also refill with your own powder once you’ve finished.

🌸 **flower knows strawberry cupid powder ; soft lavender** 4/5

one of flower knows’ most beautiful products imo. comes with a puff and has a subtle strawberry whipped cream scent. it is sheer white with a lavender tint for a gentle brightening & correcting effect, and while transparent if lightly applied, i recommend this only to light skintones. a little goes a very long way; it mattifies lightly, and sets and controls oil all day with the lightest touch, but can get powdery if you’re too heavy-handed.

🌸 **canmake marshmallow powder ; matte light** 4.5/5

a blurring filter in a compact, my holy grail of years. will leave you looking like a perfect doll with unreal skin. it offers light coverage that can be built to medium. bear in mind, this is a finishing powder rather than a setting powder - its oil control is minimal. but its ability to erase texture is unbelievable. i’ve had multiple people buy this after seeing me in it.",30

중립,How did you get the mesh off for the Flower Knows Swan powder? I've been thinking about refilling it with my own powder too (especially since it's limited edition) but I don't wanna damage the packaging.,5
긍정,"Was your colour the same on the two clio cushions? I have the glow mesh and I love it, but I’m interested in trying the other too after your review!",3
중립,Last time in Japan I eyed the canmake marshmallow powder several times but told myself I have enough powders..... But your review (and beautiful way of writing!!!) made me put it on my to buy-list once again :D,2
긍정,I have dry skin and the Clio mesh glow works in making me look normal instead of dry and patchy (yes I moisturise and prime). I thank god for it. Everything has been looking a mess on me and I was ready to give up all foundations. My skin has absorbed all the dew on it and it just looks like normal matte skin. 😅,1
긍정,What’s your method of application for best results?,1
중립,"it has the same strawberry whipped cream scent as the rest of the collection, but very very faint - almost undetectable imo.",2
중립,"i actually prefer the flower knows formula! aucoin's has that thin translucent effect that looks very natural on skin, but i found it prone to hard-pan; flower knows imo has a smoother effortless blend.

moon shadow is significantly greyer and cooler, and a little lighter / milkier. aucoin is closer to tawny tea, but it's still a bit of a darker muted brown with a clearer base and less milkiness. the swatch linked in the review has it swatched against both palettes for comparison!",4
중립,"i like romand's nu zero cushion well enough! not jawdropping, but it gets the job done.",5
중립,"Been using Hera for a few months and my fave so far

Haven't tried jungsaemmool",6
긍정,"Jung Saem Mool is my ride or die. What’s great is how it continues to mesh with your skin as the day goes on. 

It doesn’t cling to dry patches.

As for hydration, it contains glycerin, a touch of tea leaf oil, sunflower oil & safflower oil, as well as ceramides & panthenol.",5
중립,I do like clio no founwear matte,3
중립,"just got my hands on the renewed hera black cushion and my first impression has been seriously impressive. held together really beautifully by the 5hr mark, and made my skin look really porcelain. ill say for me its a medium coverage with a semi-matte finish that doesnt break up badly as you get oilier throughout the day. only thing is that my nose area (where i get the greasiest) had a little bit of breakage but held together fairly well. for note i have combo skin!

will update if anything changes on my 2nd wear though!",3
중립,Laneige neo matte,2
긍정,Hera cushion is amazing,2
중립,"Hoping someone has an answer here since there is no place to go swatch in person around here ☹️… If I’m a Jung Saem Mool cushion in Medium, what is the equivalent shade in Hera Black?",2
긍정," I love JSM. My skin is combo oily in the summer, combo dry in the winter and I haven’t noticed it clinging to dry patches. Idk how it would affect someone that’s super dry though",1
긍정,"Jung Saem Mool Skin Nuder Cover Layer (their longwear cushion is also semi-matte but I use this one specifically) is my go to. It sinks into my skin well, doesn't accentuate dryness as much as other matte cushions, and stays on well enough even when I cannot touch up. I mostly wear semi-matte foundations/cushions, and I usually don't touch up throughout the day, but may use a bit of powder or setting spray right after make up.

Out of the other cushions I tried, Missha's M Magic Cover Matte and Too Cool For School Arthouse Fixing Cover also works well, but the Missha cushion is difficult to find in my shade and gets a bit too glowy, and Too Cool For School doesn't wear as well throughout the day. Rom&nd's Nu Zero doesn't sink in to the skin for me and accentuate my pores. TirTir Red, although works well for me, may accentuate dry patches if you aren't careful about application.

I would love to try the Hera one because of the good reviews, but it's difficult to order in my shade, and my Unleashia cushion got lost in the mail, so I would appreciate some reviews for those.",1
긍정,"I've tried Clio New Founwear Matte, Laneige Neo Matte cushion (the old formulation), and the tir tir red mask fit cushion!

I love the coverage of the Laneige Neo Matte for my pores and redness - a thin layer does the trick, and then I top up with concealer for PIH or pimples that need more coverage.

Clio is great as well as it feels lightweight. My only trouble is finding a shade match as I'm in between a 3.5 and 4 ginger.

Tir tir has the best coverage imo, but can feel thicker and cakey. Moisturise and skin prep well before using as it accentuates pores and dry areas. While coverage is great,  I find that it can make my pimples more obvious.

All 3 may still crack or cake up if skin prep is not done well! But I generally think they all are great Matte cushion foundations depending on your skin type and the coverage wanted",1
중립,"not usually a matte face girlie, but once i got my hands on espoir matte cushion foundation(cuz of aespa winter being the ambassador). when applying it felt like a mask, but minutes after it really sat and i wore it so comfortably for the whole day",1

긍정,"I'm not sure if it's still being made, but IPKN had this pearlescent base with a pink tone that I really liked when I first gotten into K-beauty, but I was offput by the fragrance and decided I prefer a more matte look back then (I'd use it again if it's not ancient). Beside that, I been using the pink dual blush from Lilybyred and the pale pink shade is perfect as a blush base.",2
중립,I use Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV in lavender and VT Cica No Sebum Moisture Powder (lavender).,2
중립,"There are powders in pink and lavender. These are a few I can think of of the top of my head.

Flower Knows Ballet collection has both pink and lavender loose powder. 

Canmake Moist Powder SPF 23 PA++ comes in pink and lavender.

Koh Gen Do UV Face Powder SPF 50+ PA++++ has a pink version. I think this may be limited edition and it also has a bit of shimmer in it.

CEZANNE UV Clear Face Powder SPF 28 PA+++ comes in a lavender shade.

FWIW, pink is supposed to brighten up while lavender is to cancel out yellow tones.",3

중립,"I’m not OP, but I use this cleansing balm all the time and it’s my holy grail!

I like to use this as my first cleaner and it removes my waterproof makeup pretty quickly and easily in one wash. Granted I only really wear mascara and spf daily, but it still cuts through all my makeup when I do a full face look. I find it’s not too stripping for my skin either.

Towards the end of the night I get suuuuuper lazy with my skincare and I don’t like spending a lot of time on it. So, the fact that this takes off my makeup so quickly makes it an essential for me. Ngl if it wasn’t for this I’d probably never wear makeup",1
긍정,"I didnt realise i didnt even wrote about it oops. But its amazing, there is nothing this doesnt remove! Love how it goes from a balm to an oil to a milk and that its really gentle on the eyes and skin. Highly rate it, so far i have emptied 2 full sized tubs of it",1

I saw this in one of the Western e-magazine on top korean beauty product must-have and promptly went out to buy one.

Only slight downside is because its a tone up sunscreen, it makes my face a shade fairer (whitish cast) from my original olive skin tone.",3

중립,Etude House eyebrows which I use for years,2
중립,"Lilybyred eyeshadows and blushes definitely lean towards super light complexions.  If Daisique has any color payoff for you, you could probably try Lilybyred with some success.

Where they really shine is lip products, IMO.  Not for the staying power, but the pigmentation and comfort of wear.  I know it’s been reformulated at least once, but I’ve been loving the Bloody Liar Coating lip stains for almost a decade.",1
중립,Inga. They often have lots of 50% off and freebies if you buy more - this is only applicable if you buy from a certain app I think. Not sure if they have an international website. Can vouch for their lippies and foundation cushion (but shade range is v. limited). I'm a MAC NC 15.,1

I rarely see anything but their lip stuff on here (we love our tints). The other stuff are either 6 years old and mostly been discontinued, replaced with better products, or reformulated. They are around the price of Peripera after discounts on Olive Young.",1

긍정,"While I think Kbeauty blushes (unless they doubles as a multipot product) in general lacks color payoff, I honestly had very good experience with Lilybyred's shadows compared to the likes of Cilo, Wakemake, etc. Most of their palettes are in a super pale color scheme though, but they've released some new ones in deeper shades.

In terms of blush color payoff, I've heard the BBIA blushes are quite good, but I've not found the occasion yet to try the one I own.",1

i feel you on products getting more and more expensive (i'm canadian so our dollar sucks compared to the US dollar too). honestly it's just a matter of hunting out which sites have a good sale or promo or picking up products when i get a chance to visit asia!",3

긍정,"I love all the Hera makeup I’ve tried. Their eyeshadows are buttery on a different level form peripera or Romand, which are more powdery. Hera is a high end brand, on par with Charlotte Tilbury or Dior etc. 

1. Hera eyeshadow eye quad- buttery, long lasting and beautiful beige shadows in particular. Delicate rose is beautiful. 

2. Hera sensual glow tint- “riddler” is the perfect pinky bright lip. Not drying at all. 

3. Hera sensual nude stain- in “cool pause” is the perfect medium pink lippie. Mlbb at its best. Not glowy or matte, just natural.

4. Hera brow pencils- were great. I’ve used two of these. If I hadn’t discovered the Romand Han all in grace taupe, I’d prob still be using this. 

5. Hera nude gloss in “red lie.” It’s a gloss so the color isn’t long lasting. But it’s a warm red. I used up one of these. 

6. Hera black cushion- long lasting, semi matte. Lasts 8 hours but after that, it disappears patchily. I’ve only bought one of these and did not RP.

7. Hera UV protector tone up- beautiful pinky tone up spf. Natural looking. I’ve bought a full size and sample sachets for travel too.

8. Hera multi protector spf- a hybrid spf that looks great under makeup. Good protection and absorbs well in fall and winter. 

9. Hera radiant glow cushion- same problem as the Hera black. It’s glowy and looks great for 8 hours but after that it disappears patchily. ",20
중립,"I really like their makeup products overall! Very solid, established brand that's been around for a long time, not a flash in the pan viral brand trying to make it in the international market.",24
중립,I havent used anything because it’s a little too expensive for me but choosing Jennie for their brand is very smart. I will see an ad with her and be like “…maybe I should buy that.”,15
부정,"I don’t really care for kpop or the actresses/actors so I mainly purchase if I like the colour. I have their sensual powder matte liquid lipstick and I actually really like the formula and since I purchased it on Shopee, it was much cheaper and I think more of a $20+ pricing in my currency so wasn’t too bad. Just one con is that it doesn’t last that long and does require constant reapplication though..",10
긍정,"I have their sensual nude lip balm, the black foundation and the glow cushion. I would say everything I've bought from them so far are things I would purchase again (assuming I'm not trying something new currently). I'm looking to repurchase more colors of the lip balm. I generally don't go for liquid lipsticks as I prefer the bullet/stick types, but will probably try the nude gloss one of these days. 

Packaging is elegant, feels solid and high end. Product feels amazing on application and is comfortable to wear all day. Being a lip balm, I am quite surprised it lasts as long as it does throughout the day of me eating and drinking. The colors are really nice, and aren't too bright and cartooney like some of the other brands.

Some other posters mentioned eSpoir. They have really nice stuff too and these two brands I would say are solid buys if you want to buy something a bit fancier. Quality is on par with department store western brands, but a lot cheaper.",5
긍정,The Sensual Powder Matte lip tint are so damn good and I love the shade range. Chocolate is very close to my lip natural shade so I love it for everyday use.,4
긍정,"Hera has been around and recently reformulated the Black Cushion a few months ago 

After watching all the good reviews about the new reformulation, I just purchased it via Olive Young. I’m happy to say the shade 21N is perfect for me because so many other 21 shades are either too light (Clio) or oxidises a bit (TirTir and Laneige) 

I haven’t noticed any patchiness but I’m enjoying it so far 

I was tempted to get the lip gloss but I worry about it being too sticky so we will see",5
긍정,"Hera's Products are good quality, but I don't want to pay that price...




For a similar Lip gloss, check out BBIA Over Glaze line.",5
중립,"Not a big fan of their lip gloss since it’s sticky. I would say other Kbeauty brands like romand/peripera/amuse are wayyy better and worth it. Hera is better of with their foundations, cushions and skincare",3
긍정,"I’ve only tried a few items. 

UV Protector - lovely primer under makeup, will probably repurchase when I run out. 

Black Cushion - my initial love for this has worn off. It has a gorgeous finish for the first few hours, but when it starts to fade, it gets patchy and looks bad.

Silky Stay Foundation - very long staying power, very matte. However, no matter how I apply (fingers, brush, wet sponge), it always feels heavy on my face. 

I really wanted to fall in love with one of the foundations, but as it stands, my search will probably continue (looking for a replacement for a non-AB foundation that got retired!)",3
중립,"My mom made me get the white cast sunscreen. She said her friend said it was number 1 rated. I ended up being gifted samples of the non-white cast version too and tbh, that version had a slight white cast too. I don't like the feel of the sunscreen and don't get the hype",3
긍정,"Just splurged on some hera products and so far, the sensual nude gloss is so pretty to me. I love the color but I don't think they last long. My issue is with the silky stay foundation. It sets so fast I can't seem to find the best way to apply it. I tried using a brush and it ended up settling into my pores. So now I've just been using a flat brush to spread on my face in small sections while using a beauty sponge in my other hand to blend quickly. Has anyone found the best way to apply it?",2

긍정,I love their blushes and eyeshadows too!,1
중립,Etude doesn’t do that if you exfoliate and moisturize your lips before applying it. Peripera does that even with prep which is unfortunate because Mauve Pong is gorgeous 😭,7
중립,Unfortunately it’s discontinued but let’s hope they bring it back 😭,6
긍정,I can’t say a lot since I received it today. It is fairly durable on my lips and very comfortable. I was looking for something that gives me blurred lips look instantly and this is perfect!,5
중립,Beautiful formula and shade. I have it on my lips right now and I can barely feel it. Not drying at all,7
중립,It’s funny you say that because some of these are very cool but just look very natural on me 🙂‍↕️ For example Dusty Beige and Mauve Pong. It’s just the fact that their “coolness” is less important than them being muted. This is why I can steal from soft autumns 😏,3
중립,Uhhh I wanna try this brand. Where did you buy it?,2
중립,It reminds me of Peripera”s Captivating Pink! Also check out Inga’s lip tint in Splash 😄 That’s my next purchase,4
중립,Np 😉,2
긍정,Hmmm. Fig Fig is honestly not my fave shade on me. I’m sorry 🥲 It’s very beautiful but it’s tiiiiinyyy bit too saturated for me to feel comfortable wearing it. It looks great in the center of my lips tho!,2

I was watching a Minsco video on the Romand glosses, and she swatched this one next to some others. To me the Peripera gloss looks the closest.

중립,"A similar one, but more pigmented, is Romand Glasting Water Tint  #03 Brick River or maybe the juicy lasting tint #13 Eat Dotori. Maybe after an hour of application they'll lose color and look closer to this",9
중립,The hera is pretty sheer so honestly Id suggest looking at Laka Jelling nude glosses and see if one of them is close to this shade. 307 and 308 look appropriate. I have the fig one and its also looking close to hera speechless.,3
중립,reminds me a lot of romands vintage ocean,1
중립,"for anybody who reads this and has romand JLT in nucadamia, does it eventually turn RED red or does it stay in this almost coral-like lighter red?",10

중립,Brick River is much darker and way more orange than this.,3
중립,Oh maybe Dewyful water tint #02 Salty peach could be it,2
중립,"i think OP would find luck with Laka tints as well, but they tend to separate after time into pigment & gloss which is quite annoying :/",1

중립,Bottom lip is light while upper lip is more pigmented,3
중립,"Ooohhh Gotcha! Yes, that might happen in warmer climates cus formulas that are stable have to be kept below a certain degree or separation can occur. But it could also be the formula not aging well. Ill see how long it takes mine to separate since the climate here is not extreme temperatures. My romand lippies separated in 4 years, esp if they didnt get used too much. We will see how Laka holds.",1

부정,"I live in a similar climate but with super oily sensitive skin.


Pros:
Thin, feels like you’re not wearing anything
Not super oily (not sure on dry skin though)


Cons:
Strong scent (do they have an unscented version?)
Thin again, feels like you’re not getting enough coverage

Meh, not my favorite but not the worst that I’ve tried. 6/10",1
중립,It’s my go to vitamin c. No other ones I’ve tired that are affordable come close. Prices vary depending on where you buy it from. I got 4 from Costco in Japan and it was fairly cheap at a pack of 2 for ¥1780,2
중립,"I haven’t tried it yet, but I’m excited to!",2
중립,Those are the Botanist shampoo and treatment/conditioner refills. Larger than normal refills because I got them at Costco in Chiba.,8
중립,Which items in particular? I have a pretty set routine both for the morning and evening so I go through certain products quick enough. I don’t buy too many of a type of item if I still have new ones at home (little sunscreen and no toners here because I still have new ones at home to get through).,1

I have typical East Asian hair: thin/fine, technically a small bit of wave, but comes out straight with one pass of a comb/ brush after washing. Somewhere between 2A and 2B?",2
중립,No idea. The rates changed throughout my time there and I don’t use USD as my conversion standard.,2

In humid weather, I think its especially important to prep accordingly and use a tiniest amount of loose power to set the cushion to make sure the cushion settles well. Overall longevity is fine, though I would advise against trying to build up the coverage as you'll probably cake (regardless of what cushion, thanks humid weather). Currently though I'm using the eSpoir Be Natural cushion and I find it a nice compromise between dewy and matte cushions (coverage is on the sheer end with this one though).",5

중립,"I think consumers should see a tacky bribe for what it is: something they will never get from the brand that does this. That's it. You're not getting a Chanel bag with a tirtir product. You're getting sold a tirtir product as luxurious, by someone who got a Chanel bag to sell you that product. So, someone else is enjoying luxury on your dime. You ok with that? Buy away. 

It's the tackiest, and also grayest area of brand name associations, too. I'm eager to see what Chanel and Hermès think of it.",256
중립,Woah…that is such a weird pr tactic…tacky too imo,264
중립,Yesss keep giving rich people that put makeup on for a living more extravagant stuff that they don’t need!!! Totally makes me wanna buy from your brand!!!,265
긍정,Oh wow. Funny thing is Tirtir had enough good word of mouth to make me buy it. I picked mine up in Cosme because it was everywhere in Japan.,126
부정,This is in such poor taste. I won't be trying any brand that relies on these tactics.,112
중립,These over the top PR packages and gifts these brands do are so cringy. I also feel this way about brand trips. Like do they think the average consumer is going to be excited an influencer gets all this free shit when we’re out here struggling to make ends meet? It’s so out of touch. I get PR and sponsorships from a business standpoint. It’s cheaper for brands to do this for advertising but shit like this is so off putting.,42

긍정,"Thank you for sharing. When I saw that they gifted Darcei a bag I thought it was a genuine thank you for working with them. Especially seeing what happened with Youthforia foundation, it looked like they had a real interest in expanding their color range and learning from an actual person. I guess I was fooled! I don’t follow a lot of people and barely know Mikayla so this is surprising and pretty sad.",77
중립,Tacky. They really gifted Mikayla the liar a Hermes bag 🤦🏻‍♀️,58
중립,"Anyone that gifts Mikliar anything doesn’t get to be in my beauty arsenal. She will shill anything. Gifting her a Hermes handbag was the ultimate ick. 

I don’t know if the other gal but she is wearing a designer bag too while getting a designer bag. 

The opulence is gross.",57

She’ll say anything is the wonderful, so as long as she’s paid. There should be stricter regulations on paid partnerships and the maximum amount companies can gift someone. Gifting her an Hermes bag is very shady and unnecessary.

Adding TirTir to the list of brands I won’t be buying from. 🤥😒",36

중립,I didn’t know it was possible to make an ugly version of the Birkin. It almost looks fake.,17
중립,"Lol of all the people to gift items to, they chose these two? Fire their marketing team lol",21
중립,I thought Tirtir marketed themselves as cruelty-free/vegan? Correct me if I’m wrong though. But if that’s the case I think it’s odd for them to be gifting super expensive leather bags,12
중립,"I was literally about to buy their foundation because of the product itself, but if this is the kind of thing the brand likes to do, I'm gonna go ahead and hard pass",5
중립,"If she’s promoting it, I’m out lol.",5
긍정,"Tacky. What a way to lose a genuine customer base. I really enjoyed what Tirtir was doing, riding their online fame wave to do good things like making a diverse shade range (in comparison to Korean shades) but this is just tacky lol. I really enjoyed their cushion foundation too but I won't be buying again tbh. Hard pass. Tirtir marketing team needs to do better.",15
중립,For some reason these brands can do that but not provide bonuses or higher pay to their working class employees? Bruh 👁👄👁,18
중립,Was thinking about trying the viral foundation before but now.. God why mikayala? Why did they even think watching them give a rich tiktoker a new designer handbag would inspire me to buy tirtir?,11

중립,"yeah I was actually really excited with their new shade range and being super popular in japan (which is a hard market) already made me curious, but seeing them gift a literal hermes to an influencer has just made me totally turned off by them. I was curious but not anymore!",3
중립,"Was curious about Tirtir and wanted to try their products, but absolutely not buying anything from them now. They must not be confident in their product quality if they have to resort to paying off influencers.",10

중립,Think they’re trying to win the US market.,3
중립,Goddammit I *just* bought my first tirtir product and it hasn’t even arrived yet. I guess that’ll be the first and last time💀,6
중립,you think they’d know better than to post this..?,5
긍정,As a person with a darker skintone that would never be able to use most asian beauty complexion products I think Tirtirs whole “darker shade” roll out has been very distasteful and idk if this has changed but they left their comments open where mainly black people that called out the shade mediocrity were the punching bag of “THIS IS A KOREAN BRAND ITS NOT FOR YOU” and it honestly sucks how the darkerskin girlies they seem to mention in their ads are tan at best in western standards,8
중립,"Tirtir collaborated with Darcei to expand their shade range; the bag was just an extra on the side. From what I understand, she called them out awhile ago for having a limited foundation shade range and they reached out to her to fix that and now they have a bunch of new foundation shades for darker skin tones. The way they treated criticism from a beauty influencer (took it genuinely and did better) speaks way louder than a random bag, in my opinion.",19
긍정,"I think it’s weird for a brand to gift luxury items, but also I’m pretty sure the influencers receiving them have to pay taxes on those bags due to how expensive of a “gift” it is from the company

I love TirTir’s skincare products but I don’t know how I feel about them doing this. It feels super disingenuous towards normal consumers",3
중립,"They did give to a small poc creator too, it wasn’t just big influencers",4

중립,Anyone wondering if the bags are reps? 👀 Just me then?,2
중립,I live in Korea and the way I haven't seen anything for this brand....,2
중립,Just looked up Mikayla’s age…no WAY she’s 26 I legit thought she was over 30🥹,2
중립,"This is so schemy. I was really thinking of giving this brand a try, but not anymore!

On another note: can someone give rec for cushion foundation for acne skin? Preferably water based.",4
긍정,I'm cringing tbh. It's a good product from what I've seen so this is so extra and unnecessary as a way to curry favour. Only word comes to mind is ew.,4
긍정,weird that they need to do this when their skincare products are so good…,3
중립,"I want to know what ~~japanese~~ korean consumers think about this.

중립,"I've tried a few AB contour products and they are all quite pale & cool toned, which make my skin a little too gray and obvious. The Too Cool For School contour in Classic leans a little warmer, but still pale. My recommendation would be to branch out and try Western products, tbh.",3
긍정,"so a lot of people like cool-toned contour, regardless of your own skin tone, because shadows themselves are “cool” colors and the contour is trying to mimic those shadows. there has been a trend of using basically bronzer/warm contour, but it’s like a whole debate as to whether this is a good move or not. 

i don’t have good advice on what specifically to try (i’m really pale and i would say cool-toned, although frankly i can’t quite figure that bit out). i will say i have the art class palette and i find it barely shows up on MY skin so i might try something else first? there was a post just a couple weeks ago, i want to say, that had a GREAT breakdown on contours and while it wasn’t specifically for warm-toned tan skin, i think the info could still be valuable

(i will also add i’m not sure if the art class not showing up well if just user error. i’ve pretty new to actually wearing contour and frankly I havent looked up enough how-tos)",3

중립,"Thank you!!! My skin reacts so bad with niacinamide :( at first I was trying to power through it bc everyone says it stings at first, but I started getting pimples (probably bc of skin irritation). 

Now I'm scared of it and don't touch the stuff.",13
긍정,"I can’t wait for the day the niacinamide craze is over. It doesn’t irritate my skin much at small doses (<5%) but when 90% of your routine has sneaky niacinamide, it just causes more and more irritation. I’d be perfectly happy to have Cica in every product rather than niacinamide (or hyaluronuc acid or vit c, for the record)",13

중립,"A bit late to the party but thanks for this! I've slowly been trying to eliminate niacinamide from all my routine but totally forgot about base makeup! I knew it was in everything these days as far as skincare but geez, adding it to makeup too is ridiculous.

중립,"I feel your pain 😫 A few years ago my skin was so angry after using a product with 10% niacinamide. It's been pretty calm until I used the romand Nu Zero cushion. My skin got red and broke out.

중립,"A cushion is a compact with a cushion inside, it's drenched with a liquid formula. You pick up the product with a puff that's included. You can press the cushion and product comes out on the puff. So it's basically liquid foundation/BB/CC-cream type product in a cushion. Sometimes it's a jelly texture (but then it's not called a cushion foundation afaik), which isn't housed in a cushion. It still comes with a puff to apply. Hope this kind of makes sense?",10

*Skin Type: combination leaning dehydrated and semi oily

*Environment: Florida : Hot and Humid

1)  **Neogen: Serum Spray H2 Dermedica** 

Product Type: serum

Purported Effect: skin barrier support

Texture: fine mist

Scent: faint 

Experience: non irritating.  Feels hydrating.  Smooth application.  Will need to keep using to see any effects

*Rating: 7/10*



2)  **Neogen: Extra long lash metal serumscara in purple** 

Product Type: mascara

Purported Effect: nourishing mascara

Texture: very smooth but buildable

Scent:  faint

Experience: love the heavy duty container.  Love the easily sterilized applicator.  Love the refill option.  Love that it doesn't clump on the applicator so it's easy to apply in thin layers. And easily to wipe off the applicator without losing lots of product.   Really lifts and separates and is a cool deep charcoal mixed with dusky purple hue. 

*Rating: 9/10*


3)  **Neogen: White Truffle Ampoule drop must ** 

Product Type: serum mist

Purported Effect: nourishing and hydrating

Texture: fine mist

Scent: faint

Experience:  very much reminds me of the D'alba that I've tried prior. But less scented

*Rating: 7/10*


4)  **Neogen: Collagenique** 

Product Type:  ampoule

Purported Effect: lifting and plumping

Texture: thick essence 

Scent: faint rosey maybe

Experience: I'm not sure of its effect yet, but I really like the texture and the immediate feeling of hydration. Absorbs rapidly so great for layering

*Rating: 7/10*



5)  **Neogen: Bio Gauze Green Tea** 

Product Type: hybrid chemical and physical exfoliator 

Purported Effect: skin smoothing

Texture: rough on one side of the pad, soft on the other

Scent: green tea with maybe a hint of citrus

Experience: I love these pads. This is the last sent in the line that I had not tried yet. I have tried the wine and lemon prior. This one seems the best for sensitive skin, because the green tea feels more soothing. I just love how versatile these things are. Depending on how much exfoliation you need, you could use one, either or both sides. Extremely practical

*Rating: 10/10⭐HG⭐*



6)  **Neogen: Real Cica Pad** 

Product Type: skin calming and repair

Purported Effect: soothing of irritation and removal of dead skin cells

Texture: serum type texture on thin smooth pads.

Scent:  faint 

Experience: The bar is pretty high on pads from this brand. And these are just not a material that I like as well as their other ones. However the solution they are soaked in is wonderful. They have a second type of seeka pad I will definitely try next. I'm sure the super smoothness of these pads was intentional to avoid additional irritation, But that definitely impacts the way they can be used as more of a swipe on for a hands-off approach to serum delivery, versus a soaking mechanism to hold on your skin for a while, because the serum doesn't seem to really be soaked into the pad, so much as sitting on it externally.

*Rating: 6/10*

 the youth repair probiotic cream is great. It's a thicker lotion.  But doesn't clog pores. I don't have acne issues but it does feel like it'd soothe and alleviate the irritation of those most likely.  

I didn't use the acne cleanser cause it doesn't suit my skin type so I gave it to a friend.  

The other two cleansers I gave my mom and she really liked them.  She likes the green one best she said but both were non stripping for her.  

The prep toning pad I haven't used, I keep it in my purse.  

The vitamin c is super potent and Incredible.  I'll buy the full size of that and something from the probiotic line for sure!",2

Then the last 3 years of those 20 I developed cystic from hormones. It was awful, and my skincare knowledge was still very 2000-2009 so I had to do a deep dive. After like a year of testing different things:

Spironolactone, oral. This is a holy grail for not just acne, but my mood. I think all the testosterone in my body was making me a hell of a grump.

Tretinoin, topical. Sometimes I hate this stuff because it still makes me peel, but it clears my acne up. Usually use it every 2 days. I can tolerate it a bit more when it's warm and humid where I live.

Humidifier. It's a must in the cold or I look like a snake. 

My weekend spa days. I use Innisfree's Volcanic Pore Mask which has lactic acid in it, I'm From's Honey Mask, and after my shower a Klair's Sheet Mask. The next day my skin is glowing and my pores are an after thought.

Day / night: COSRX's Snail Mucin 96 (healing and hydrating), Skinfood's Royal Honey Propolis (the glow!), a few different moisturizers just depending on time of year and my skin's needs (Farmacy, Youth to The People Adaptogen Cream, and Neogen's Probiotic Cream), and La Roche Posay's Cicaplast Baume when it's cold. Sounds like a lot, but makeup even sits well over it all.

Also, I “sandwiched” the heck out of this. Meaning: I put on a hydrating toner and a serum BEFORE the bha. And I put on a moisturizer AFTER the epiduo. I stopped ALL actives for 1 week after doing this. In the two to three days that followed i looked like a light bulb 😂 (in the best way), I couldn’t believe it. It looked like I had gotten a professional micro peel done. And I Wore sunscreen religiously! I think I may do this once a month, as my skin is now used to the epiduo/ retinol.

It’s my HG, already have backup. And I noticed just how much my skin loves niacinamide so I tried cos de baha niacinamide and tranexamic acid serum and of course I loved it, already ordered two more. It hydrated my skin very well, gives a glass skin like finish and makes my skin texture free. So I would say these three are new 2023 purchases that I fell in love the most.

긍정,"Lots of Misses, but my actual favourite purchases this year are...

**Omi Sunbears Active Protect Milk Spf50 PA++++:** minimal whitecast that goes away, matte finish, good oil control, very affordable, super cute packaging and delicious grapefruit scent 😍 i have the review post on my profile. 

**Aestura Atobarrier 365 Hydro Essence:** Calming, soothing, hydrating, barrier repair, feels heavenly on the skin upon application, dries down pretty quick. Replacing my old HG that's now discontinued, Illiyoon Probiotics Skin Barrier Essence Drop.

**In2it Duo Lipstick:** bullet matte lipstick on 1 end, and shiny liquid lip on the other. Both ends are completely not drying on my lips. I love the formula of the matte in particular so so much and i also love the share range of their lipsticks. I plan to purchase another duo lipstick in the future.

**Purbasari Lip Color Matte:** I like the shades and they are very opaque. But the formula is kinda drying ngl and very flimsy packaging. The shades and opacity kinda makes up for it lol.

중립,"About me: early 30's, combination skin, living in USA east coast, around a 23 cushion shade.

New-to-me items purchased this year:

* Dinto blur glowy lip tint. Honestly changed my mind on glossy lip tints even though I had quite a few to begin with.
* Espoir sleek lipstick. Nothing mindblowing, it's just a really pretty base color.

Repurchases from this year:

* benton bakuchiol – this has changed my skin for the better. I've noticed when I don't use this (or when I swapped to the cos de baha retinol for a while), my skin didn't feel as plump/firm and felt more textured. Plus, my hormonal zits came back with a vengeance without this.
* be ready cushion in 02 ryan – this is my HG cushion, but I think it's been reformulated (or if not that, then redesigned) so after I finish the 2 refills that I have, I guess I'll check the new version out.
* espoir brow balance pencil – i already had colors 01-04, but the newest colors (05&06) are the perfect shade to fill in my brows without it looking tattoo'd on.
* peripera ink glowy tint – i was always a matte girl but after turning into a semi gloss girl (and finally trying the one I bought last year), I got more of these, as I really like the tint left behind AND it somehow lasted through a whole broadway show even though I wore a mask!!

things i bought last year but finally used this year and would probably repurchase next year:

* numbuzin no. 3 toner – when I ran out of my missha artemesia fte, I replaced it with this and omg my skin was so freaking glowy to the point where my mom was like why are you so oily and I was like .... i'm not literally my skin is squeaky clean LOL
* a'pieu raspberry vinegar – i swear my dandruff went away the minute I started incorporating this into my hair care routine. I always had really bad dandruff but I guess this helps get any of that last remaining shampoo that I can't see/feel out of my scalp as well. Plus, my hair always felt super soft after using it.n
* needly daily toner pads – I've so far gone through quite a few toner pads this year, and these are still my HG/absolute favorite. They're huge, they're super gentle, and I swear my face stayed clear the longest even during my period when I had these in my routine. I already have a 2-pack I want to open, but I'm trying to get through my massive stash of other toner pads first 😅.

Also realizing I barely shopped this year when compared to last year! Go me for actually using my stash 😂🙈.",10

I ran out of the original formula this summer so unfortunately I can't post side by side swatches, but I'll share a great comparison by this Korean blogger which is very accurate.

Basically the new shade is almost identical to the old one. It's slightly less saturated and slightly cooler, but I only noticed these differences when I swatched them side by side, on the lips they looked identical to me.

In terms of formula the new edition is quite different from the previous one, it's much more glossy and they changed the plumping effect from a warming tingle to a cooling one, so I find it more comfortable and longlasting.

Their lip balm range was reformulated as well but the Gold Lingerie shade was only a limited edition so you won't find it in the new line. The closest match I can think of is Poiret's ""Sheer Glow Lip Color"" in shade 103 Du Matin.",12

긍정,"Thank you! My wishlist was heavily influenced by Odile Monod's content.   
So far I've tried:  
\- The history of Whoo bichup anti-aging concentrate (in conjunction with the Whoo first moisture essence): I love them! They made my skin more radiant from the start. But what I really love is that it sinks right into my skin. My skin is very dehydrated but despite that fact, most of the products I've tried in the past sit on top of my skin and make it look shiny/greasy. But those two are amazing when it comes to penetrating my skin. 

\- The Sooryehan black serum: I had high hopes for this one but unfortunately didn't notice much of a difference on my skin. Maybe it's because I've introduced it in my routine after the history of Whoo products.

\-The Decorte liposome advanced serum: I love this one. I struggle with  under eyes dehydration lines and this serum made the biggest difference in plumping them.

\- Centellian24's Expert madeca ampoule: I don't think I will repurchase this one. I used it for a little longer than 2 months but didn't notice a big difference on my hyperpigmentation. 2 months is probably not enough for making a big difference on my sun spots but it didn't help with my red marks either. 

\- ISOI blemish care serum: another serum to tackle hyperpigmentation. I've introduced it in my routine 2 weeks ago but I prefer it over the Centellian24 one. I like its texture (watery gel, whereas the Madeca ampoule has an oily base) and it seems to do a better job at fading my red PIH.",9

What I can tell is that I enjoy the texture, it's watery, spreads easily. I use it in the morning and it works well with the rest of my routine. It's worth noting that it has a strong rose scent, I personally don't mind but it's not subtle.

I started with the Madeca ampoule first, I bought them to treat the same issue and   
I prefer the ISOI one.",6

긍정,"I like it a lot, it's a solid sunscreen. It might have become a staple for me but the CNP outdoor fluid which is very similar suits me better. My skin type is a bit tricky, I'd say it's normal to dry, tends to be dehydrated. Pros: very nice milky texture, easy to spread, no white cast (but I'm not exactly tan). Con: it has a rather dewy finish on me and I prefer when it's matte because I don't use any makeup product to control the shine. Also, note that it's fragranced (something flowery but doesn't seem to linger). I tried it in Europe in the winter and in Thailand in the summer,  it worked well in each case. I looked like a grease ball in Thailand because of the humidity but I didn't tan at all so it did its job pretty well. I hope I didn't answer too late",2

Curie essence and serum, if I have the opportunity I'll probably repurchase them (unless I find a good deal on the EGF serum from BioEffect instead).

긍정,"Hi! So I finally gave in and opened all the products with the exception of the Donginbi essence. I think I now have a fairly good idea of the products I'll repurchase.   
Among the Isa Knox items that would  be the Eye for all cream. I'll try to get the jumbo size next time. The wrinkle for all serum is also a good product  but I don't think I'll repurchase it simply because it's (too) mild. It was my first retinoid and it was really gentle, it didn't irritate me despite my rosacea.  But ultimately I just want to use a stronger retinoid. The tervina cold cream was a total miss sadly. I only tried it once or twice but the first impression was so underwhelming that I still haven't used it since. It's very rich and it left a film on my skin. Maybe I can use it as a first step in my cleansing routine. And finally, I also had some travel sizes of the Age focus prime ampoule and emulsion which I enjoyed using, especially the emulsion. I really like that galenic form and Ill try one from The Whoo or Sooryehan next time.

And the biggest miss will probably be the Isa Knox massage cream. I tried it once and it is way too heavy for my skin. But I kinda knew it from the start as it is targeted at mature skin. That's what I get for fangirling a bit too much I guess. Thank you for your comment :)",3

긍정,"Now that I remote work a part of the week I've been on the search for a kbeauty tone up sunscreen that will even out my skintone because I don't want a full face of makeup on at home. I'll wear tone up spf, dab on a little corrector under my eyes and wear color lip balm. This is a review of all of the high end department store tone up spfs I've used this summer. My skin type is combination oily in the summer. More normal the other seasons. The climate I am currently in itgesummer. My routine is currently carenology multi toner, Saro de rue ginseng essence, Sunday Riley vitamin c serum, wellage hydrating blue hydrating ampoule, mamonde blue chamomile soothing repair cream. 

&#x200B;

1. Lancome UV Expert Youth Shield Milky Bright tone up spf- this is a korea only spf from lancome to my knowledge. Yesstyle has it, but I asked my aunt to bring me two bottles of this last year. This absorbs extremely well, has great spreadability, tones up about 1/4 of a shade, and works beautifully under makeup. Consistency is like a cream when you squeeze it out of the tube. Around $65 in korea so not cheap at all. It is a hybrid sunscreen with titanium dioxide so that's why it absorbs and spreads better than a pure physical sunscreen. I'd rebuy this.
2. History of Whoo Radiant White tone up spf- this is from the high end department store brand the History of Whoo which is under the LG umbrella. I bought mine off yesstyle, but testerkorea also has it. This also absorbs very very well, has great spreadability, tones up 1/3-1/2 of a shade (so a bit more than the lancome), and also sits really nicely under makeup. The consistency however, is more liquidy and like a lotion than a cream. Around $31 when I bought with a discount code. It is also a hybrid spf with zinc oxide and niacinamide in it for skin brightening effect. I would most definitely rebuy this in light of it being cheaper than the Lancome spf.
3. Hera UV Protector Tone up spf- this sunscreen is from the brand Hera, which is under the Amore pacific umbrella. I bought sample satchets from testerkorea. This also absorbs well, but not as well as the history of whoo spf. Maybe because it's a cream consistency. It also works well under makeup, but I'd say not as well as the history of whoo one. It is $38 for the full sized version. This is a hybrid sunscreen with titanium dioxide in it.

Conclusion: I like all of them, but think the Lancome spf and History of Whoo spf absorb a little bit faster than the Hera spf and therefore gives it an edge. In terms of cost efficiency, the History of Whoo spf was the cheapest for a 50ml tube so go for that obviously! If you're like me Mac NC15-20 the tone up effect will be perfect. If you're darker, then obviously the tone up effect will be more impactful on you. I also note each spf has a lightly floral scent the way a lot of Korean department store brand products do.

Also a random bit of Kbeauty gossip to share, I follow an MUA who is the owner and head MUA of Soonsoo shop, a famous hair and makeup wedding shop in Kangnam, Seoul on youtube and watch her videos regularly. She's raved about the lancome spf in particular in a number of videos and said she's reached out to Lancome several times to say ""let's do a sponsored video together, I'll advertise for you on my youtube channel"" and they declined politely saying ""our sales in korea for that spf is already extremely robust so we don't bother assigning any marketing money within the company budget for that, thanks, but no thanks!"" So if you're wondering why this lancome korea only spf doesn't seem to be mentioned much by youtubers of social media influencers, that's the reason. It's already so famous in korea and sells so well that Lancome feels no need to advertise further. Their existing customers already buy millions of them year.",14

중립,"Thanks for the reviews! 

I'm really getting into Whoo right now so I'm strongly tempted 😊

What's the fragrance like for the Whoo one?",1
중립,"which tone up effect is better between whoo, lancome, and hera??",1
중립,It’s a very light floral scent. Almost no scent at all to me.,3
중립,Whoo > Lancôme > Hera. But the whoo tone up is so brightening of a tone up that if you’re darker than me (I’m a 22 in Korean cushions or a light 23) then it might look like a white cast rather than a tone up effect. The Lancôme tone up was the most balanced tone up with opacity in my opinion. But the Whoo is cheaper so there’s that. They also all absorbed fairly well compared to “clean” beauty brands but I still think the Whoo and Lancôme absorbed a tiny bit better than the Hera.,2
긍정,"Awesome, thank you 😊",1
긍정,"thank you for answering 🥰 sorry, but what do you mean by clean?",1
중립,"So a lot of clean beauty brands in America and Korea (think Aestura or Atobarrier for kbeauty) say they use minimal ingredients and nothing harsh or potentially irritating to the skin for ppl with eczema. The problem is that these ingredients are in spf and lotions for a reason. Some of the ingredients that get cut are absorption aiding ingredients that help your skin absorb and soak in the spf quickly for instance. You know how kbeauty spf generally absorb better than neutrogena or American pharmacy spfs? It’s usually because they’re more elegantly formulated to absorb better. But with the rise of “clean” beauty brands those ingredients get eliminated. And the problem is for those of us who aren’t allergic or sensitive to those ingredients, it actually helps to have those ingredients in. Because otherwise I have to wait 10 min in the morning for my spf to absorb before putting on makeup and that’s just time wasted for me when I need to catch a train and get to work. For people whose skin aren’t prone to eczema those clean beauty brands aren’t worth it for me. Which is why I stick to the big name dept store brands like History of Whoo, Lancôme, or Hera.",3

중립,"I have all the warm tones from the Peripera Fall in Acorn collection and they are my most loved by far. I keep trying to wear summer peachy colours lately, but they are just too bright for me really. If I put a layer of Acorn Brown over top though, it mutes things down a bit better.

I got a color analysis done in Korea and was an autumn mute- the lady actually recommended Muziage Mansion- Stranger for my lip color, and it's been my go to ever since!  It really suits warm tones perfectly without being too orange- I actually get compliments when I wear it out. It's not super long lasting, but I don't mind reapplying because of the subtle rose scent and the pretty packaging. It's a pleasure to use!",2

긍정,Yes 1 and 4 are probably the best matching. I'd say 5 is quite neutral leaning but too dark.,18

중립,"I enjoy it; a natural looking foundation/ skin like finish (my preference), feels quite thin on the skin, doesn't cake up and seems long lasting. Wouldn't suggest for people with oily skin as it can get a bit greasy by the end of the day. 

I apply by dabbing on my skin or using a spatula, then a cushion puff to blend out. Honestly there is little difference in the end result between the spatula and fingers.",3

For some time now, the skin around my mouth and chin have been irritated and itchy after using moisturizers and makeup. As I have sensitive skin I tried to cut out some ingredients like talc, for example. Then I noticed that not all products made my skin itchy. So I looked for a common ingredient in all of them and bam: niacinamide. What I learned was that my skin tolerates a certain amount of the component. For example: if I only use moisturizer with niacinamide and the rest of the products without it, it's ok. But if I build up several layers of things with niacinamide, after half an hour it becomes red, itchy and bumpy.",3

I see fragrance in them and if it is light I can tolerate it but if it is super strong it will end up going to waste because I get migraines...  Roll of the dice I guess.

긍정,"My New HG Sunscreen! I wanted to provide my review of this sunscreen. I first heard of this sunscreen earlier in the fall and then saw some great reviews of it from the youtubers Odile and Yootrue. I agree with what they have said, it is very spreadable, absorbs easily and quickly, has that hybrid sunscreen feeling to it, as in not overly matte like some physical sunscreens, making this a great fall and winter spf. It leaves a lightly hydrated skin expression that is perfect for applying makeup afterwards. Apparently, lots of women in korea use this spf as a primer sunscreen (as in a sunscreen that also acts as a primer) and I have to agree that it DOES perform the way a hydrating base product does. The closest skin expression I can compare this to is the Dr Jart Everyday sun screen spf 50 (which is now sadly discontinued). Probably because they are both hybrid sunscreens with a hydrating finish that is somehow not overly dewy. I am about 2/3 done with the Hera spf tube and I would 100% repurchase this! I like this even better than the other hybrid sunscreen I tried this year, the Mediheal tea tree hybrid sunscreen. It somehow feels like it absorbs a bit faster and I need that in the mornings when I'm rushed. 

I note, the physical sunscreen ingredient is titanium dioxide, but I found it wasn't as drying or not spreadable the way some sunscreens with this ingredient can be. Probably because it is mixed with chemical sunscreen filters as well.

I bought mine off of stylevana, but it was available at Yesstyle at some point too.  I'd be curious to know if anyone on this sub has tried the Hera UV tone up sunscreen to see how it compares.",19
중립,thanks for the review,3
중립,I’m so glad you posted this review! I was going to review it (but not as glowing as yours) but I’ve misplaced it before taking a texture shot and I kind of just just shrugged off the review 😂,3
중립,Off topic a little bit but how long did it take for Stylevana to ship your order after placing it?,1
중립,"I have this on my backups to use next. I got mine off yesstyle, which legit took 21 days to ship :(",1
중립,[deleted],1
중립,"Do you know what is the chemical sunscreen in this? And did you try it under makeup, does it pill?",1
중립,I tried the tone up. But it make my skin too oil after an hour. Even though I have dry skin …,1
중립,I think a little under 3 weeks. It didn’t matter to me since I always keep sunscreen on deck but if you need one right away maybe try somewhere else?,2
중립,"Of course, I am normal in the winter and combination oily in the summer. Something in between those two things in the spring and fall.",2
긍정,"My understanding is it has  Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate. It did not pill at all and has never pilled even though my skincare became heavier during the winter. My skin absorbed it immediately and both matte foundation and semi matte foundation as well as glowier foundations/bb creams all sat beautifully on top of it. The fact that it doesn't pill under makeup is a part of why I love this so much.",3
중립,Ohhh interesting. I have normal to combination oily but I was fine with it. But maybe it’s bc I wear makeup over it and set with powder? I never wear just spf…I’ll set with a transparent powder over it just because I produce too much oil on my tzone otherwise.,1
긍정,Yes. It’s great under make up I have to say. Is this hera sunscreen non-comedogenic if you have any idea?,1
중립,"Sorry, I have no idea. I don’t even know the Korean word for non-comedogenic so I can’t even check.",1
중립,It’s like the company promise the item  is specially formulated as not to cause blocked pores.,1
중립,"Oh yeah, I’ve never found it to block my pores, either the multi defense or the tone up version.",2
중립,"Do we really have to apply “ 2 fingers line” to have the protection? I feel like it too much sometimes 😅
How would you apply them?",1
중립,"Yeaaaa, I’d say I apply about 1 finger and a half. I apply it in two layers. First I apply a layer all over the face. Then I concentrate the second layer on my cheeks and temples where I’m prone to freckling and melasma. Then I tap my face using my fingers 20 times. Then I have to wait a full five min before putting on makeup. Usually I’ll get dressed and go wash my hands while I’m waiting.",3
중립,"This was announced a few weeks ago and waiting to be able to buy it was hard. I never thought I’d be excited for a sunscreen release but here I am. These are really first impressions as I’ve only wore it for half a day yesterday as soon as I got it in the mail (I love working from home). 

Per the product page, the fresh is marketed as a 100% chemical sunscreen that’s hydrating  and adheres to the skin and feels light. It’s supposed to not be sticky at all, not irritate, help improve the skin barrier, and calm skin. It’s registered as having 3 properties: protect from UV, help with whitening and help with wrinkles. It’s also reef-friendly and the cap is made from recycled plastic. 

In comparison, the original one is a hybrid sunscreen that promises to moisturize, help the skin barrier and give you a glow. It’s also registered as having the same 3 properties. 

My thoughts:

Skin type: dehydrated combinaison skin. I don’t get too oily but can get quite dry. 

I started using the original last fall when I messed up my skin barrier and couldn’t tolerate anything including sunscreens. This product never irritated me and I believe was a big help to getting my skin back on track. It was definitely a winner for me in the cold winter as it was moisturizing enough to use without a cream. But, with the weather getting warmer I was definitely looking for something else as the glow was starting to be a little much now that my skin wasn’t that dry anymore. 

In comparison, the fresh is definitely a lot lighter. It feel fresh when going on and just sinks into my skin without having to work it as much as the original. It does give me a glow but not nearly as much as the original. It also doesn’t sting my eyes, like the original. 
So, unless I get a horrible reaction to it I think I’ll be happily using this as my transition sunscreen between winter and summer!",66

긍정,"Great to see this sunscreen getting some love here!!  
I love Hera sunscreens so I've been really looking forward to this release and I share your same first impressions. I love how they created a lighter version of the Multi-Defense sunscreen, while still maintaining a great oil/water balance for dehydrated skin. I've only had it for a week, but I can already tell I'll use it a lot this year 😁",43
중립,Dang it I wish they were fragrance/essential oil free 😿,15
긍정,"Oooh, this sounds lovely and thank you for the review! Where did you purchase? I’m only seeing the older version on Stylevana and Yesstyle",5
중립,Is there any whitecast?,3
긍정,"Do you have the link you use to buy these products? If you do, would mind sharing it here. Thank you!",1
중립,fragrance wise is it super strong & lingering?,1
중립,Is there any indication of its actual UV protection? After the huge scandal last year I would’ve thought there’d be more openness about what SPF and UV protection these products actually provide.,0
중립,i bet it will be pricy. i hope their will be no decyl glucoside or alcohol in other way that's a miss.,0
긍정,"How strong is the scent and what type was it (floral, herbal, vanilla, etc)?  If you have a chance I'd love to know!",1
중립,"Pretty sure this is another BoJ/Roundlab/Skin1004/BePlain derivative..

Someone should keep a count of how many sunscreens use this base formula.",12
중립,And it's all thanks to you! Your video on Hera sunscreens convinced me to give it a try and I haven't looked back since! I'll have to see how it is indoor in summer for me but I see myself using this until at least May.,11
중립,This is kinda off the topic. But the hera tone up version kinda make me look oily at the t-zone if I want to use as “3 fingers rule “? Is it too much of sunscreen ? Is that how we supposed to use? Or can I use Fresh underneath and the tone up on top? Will that mess up the sunscreen? Always like your review!!,1
중립,I don’t get why people put essential oils in sunscreen.,4
중립,I’m in Korea so I purchased directly from the Hera online store. I guess international websites should have it in a few days/weeks? I’m honestly not sure how long it takes for new releases to be available.,9
중립,"There's absolutely none on me (#13-17 in Korean foundation colors), and since it only contains chemical filters I believe most people could use it without experiencing a white cast",3
중립,[This is the only place](https://brand.naver.com/hera/products/7889811808) I've seen the fresh version online for now. I know some people use shopping services to buy things from Korea so that would be an option if you want to buy it now. I'm sure international sites will have it in a few days/weeks.,2
중립,"To me, the scent is light and fresh (I keep using that word but they just really named it well lol) and doesn't linger at all after application.",2
중립,I didn’t think to mention it in the post but it’s 50+ PA++++.! It’s made by Amore Pacific which is a long standing Korean company that does a lot of R&D so I would say I personally 100% trust this sunscreen to deliver the protection it promises.,5
중립,"It’s not very strong at all and doesn’t linger. I would describe it as blue/fresh, light and slightly sweet. It kind of smells fruity in a way (but not citrusy)",2
중립,"Similar ingredients, but HERA is under AmorePacific. I doubt AP would be using Kolmar's base formula (BoJ/RoundLab's sunscreen manufacturer) when they have the ability to make things in-house?   

Looking at the link OP provided to Odile's website, it looks like it was manufactured and formulated by AmorePacific...",8
중립,"I haven't tried any of those so I can't compare the formula. 

The product page for the original UV defense says it's made by Amore Pacific, but on the fresh's product page it says made by both Amore Pacific and Kolmar. So that might be why there are some similarities",2
중립,i’d like to see that list cause my acne prone skin loves this formula,1
중립,Me either. I feel like it really limits the market of consumers who can use their product. On the other hand there are a lot of people that smell a product when they pick it up and some don’t care about scent. I don’t own a single product with fragrance or essential oils and never will,4

중립,"Thanks for the answer, might check it out!",1
중립,"The standard Multi-Defense sunscreen is indeed a proprietary formula, but this new Fresh version was outsourced to Kolmar Korea.",22
중립,"Perhaps so! But sunscreen is notoriously difficult to formulate so it doesn't surprise me that they outsourced. Pretty sure most brands formulate most of their stuff in-house...sunscreen is a totally different story.

중립,"The standard Multi-Defense sunscreen is indeed a proprietary formula, but this new Fresh version was outsourced to Kolmar Korea.",9
중립,The BePlain & Skin1004 have the least ingredients / extracts!,2
중립,So many essential oils are reactive to uv too.  There’s just no logic to it….,3
긍정,Huh. Thank you for the clarification! Is it a common practice for brands with their own R&D to outsource like this?,8
긍정,"The Fresh version is based on the same Kolmar formula as the Makeprem indeed, but to be fair Amorepacific is known for having some of the best sunscreen formulators in Korea. All the other Hera sunscreens have proprietary formulas and have been around for a long time.

I don't know why they decided to outsource this new version, but I doubt it's because they couldn't create a similar formula. Incidentally, the new Espoir sunscreen launched a few weeks ago has a proprietary formula by AP and it's a lot more lightweight than the new Multi-Defense Fresh so this business choice has little to do with their level of expertise.",13
긍정,I honestly didn’t think of checking this before buying and just assumed it would be an AP formula. Good lesson for the future to always double check!,2
중립,"That's my concern. The more extracts, the more likely to get a reaction. I stick to those I know have benefits. Thanks OP for sharing your impression. And my appreciation to Odile for videos on SPF!",2
중립,"It's a common way to keep costs down for diffusion lines or for seasonal products. Even if a brand has their own R&D and manufacturing facilities, producing something completely in-house it's still very costly (they have to pay for raw materials, operating costs of the manufacturing facilities etc etc). And when you sell products for i.e. 5-20 dollars, this means that your profit margin is essentially peanuts. It's just cheaper to pay a flat rate to an ODM.

That being said, it's very unusual for a company with their own R&D (and a dedicated sunscreen research team on top of that) to outsource formulation of their high-end lines like in this case. I'm quite puzzled about this strategy myself, especially since AP recently launched a new sunscreen under Espoir with a proprietary formula 🤷‍♀️ so why keep formulation in-house for a drugstore brand but not for their flagship sunscreen brand that gave their sunscreen research team the reputation they have today? I can't wrap my head around it. 

As confusing as LG's marketing choices may be, I've got to give it to them for formulating everything in-house, even their most affordable diffusion lines. I always thought the reason why they manage to pull it off is that they have 5 very successful luxury and premium brands so the profits they make from those brands probably go on to cover the production costs of their diffusion lines.",16
중립,"I just checked the Espoir also has a ""Fresh"" version that uses the same formulas as the Hera, Make p:rem, etc.",3
중립,"I was not expecting it either, AP has never outsourced formulation of their high end lines before 🤔",6
중립,"Yeah, I was thinking it was odd for AP to outsource sunscreen for a higher end line. I'd be less puzzled if they outsourced for a lower end brand like Etude... But now you're telling me they created an in-house formula for Espoir. I'm so confused by AP these days 😵   

How you describe LG's formulation/production system is how I assumed every large cosmetics corporation would do it. Being able to keep everything in-house production-wise seems like a bit of a flex, IMO. Kind of instills consumer confidence in me? Like I'd be willing to look into LG's brand offerings more because of it 😅",4
중립,"Yeah that one has been around for a while, I was talking about the new  ""Water Splash Sun Cream Ceramide"".

The Fresh version had to be relaunched in a rush a few years ago because the original manufacturer was involved in a case of IP theft, so AP went ahead and bought the rights to the infamous Kolmar base formula that everyone is using these days.",5
긍정,"Do you have the ingredients for that one? Not that I don't trust you because you definitely seem like know what you're talking about, but I have FA so I always have to analyze ingredients for potential triggers. Thank you!",2
중립,"Of course, no problem at all!

긍정,"It's actually super interesting that you ask that because one of the main controversies is that it doesn't have a solid definition!

""Clean beauty"" is not a goverment regulated or scientific term, so it just means whatever a marketing team wants it to mean. It can imply any number of things: naturally derived, cruelty free, nontoxic, fragrance free, evironmentally conscious etc. The list really goes on, and its vague definition means that companies can just slap it on almost any product to get marketing buzz.

Some of these aspects (like environmentally conscious and cruelty free) are actually good things, and are positive trends that the beauty market is moving in! However, there can also be a lot of anti-science rhetoric when talking about clean beauty, especially when it's paired with terms like ""natural"", ""chemical free"", ""detoxifying"", or ""nontoxic"". Because of the anti-science rhetoric paired with it, I think it generally does more harm than good.

부정,"I think what bother me the most is that if brands really wanted to be more eco responsible, they would be more transparent about where and how they source their ingredients, what goes into making the products, the packaging and what they actually do to lessen the environmental impact. Vegan doesn't mean better (unless you are vegan and that's your lifestyle obviously) as you can use plants and destroy their habitats if you harvest them incorrectly, or harm the population if the workers receive unethical treatment and poor pay. 

So we get buzzwords and fear mongering but very little actual action.

However, I agree that there are some good steps taken such as the push towards cruelty free products, and that maybe it's just the beginning of the movement and brands will get more transparent and responsible as time goes on 🤔

The time reset aqua essence was my first tranexamic acid based product. Its so watery yet it made my face feel plump like how more viscous toner does??? Plus evening out my tone?? Ugh so good. I finished my bottle straight and was gonna repurchase but i decided to try out sk-ll dupes. 

The ipsa me moisturizer/emulsion is interesting. I have it in no.2 which is on the light end and the formula is interesting. It comes off as very watery lotion yet its kinda this fatty layer on the skin thats moisturizing and sufficient enough for my oily skin. Overall they are really good but i kinda found some dupes for it for way cheaper so its like yes i love them and i think the formula is innovative but i'll think twice about repurchasing.

Also, I want to bring up the whole how dumb it was to do a “coral safe” revamp when it was all fearmongering, but that’s definitely above my language skills",2
긍정,"My nose is questionable at best right now so I'll have to update later if my impression has changed lol.  

It's fruity floral, kind of firmly balanced in the middle. A little bit tart, but has a sweet undertone. My brain seems to be under the impression that it smells ""pink"". I don't think it's a particularly strong fragrance either, but that's always subjective. It reminds me of how Shiseido's Ultimune Serum smells but better? And with no alcohol-y opening either.   

Not going to lie, I wish it was easier to purchase samples of jbeauty the same way it is for kbeauty. But returning to Decorte from their US website was pretty hassle free in my very limited one-time experience. Though IIRC, you had to pay for return shipping either through a shipping label they provide or opt to create your own. (To be completely fair though, that's how a lot of US websites for AB brands seem to do things these days.)",6

긍정,"Smells pink?  🤣 why do I actually understand exactly what you mean? 😂.  I think I may just have to take a chance on it.  So far, I’ve done okay with fragranced stuff.  My face wash, Comfort Zone Essential Face Wash even has bergamot and lavender undertones, and I’m okay with it.

So this is nuts:  I use cold-pressed sunflower oil to oil cleanse, and this month they mistakenly sent me lavender.  I used it for a few days without any trouble, surprisingly, and then found out it was the wrong one.  I could smell it but thought I was just tripping tbh.  

Thank mercy I wasn’t out in the sun anywhere, but the moral of the story is:  maybe I can cope.  

It’s the linalool and citrus stuff that I cannot take.  Guess I’ll have to buy it find out….",6
긍정,"It's probably the association of scents with colored packaging! Though in the fragrance circle, aquatic scents are associated with blue, and herbal is usually associated with green for example. But florals end up being broken up into white, yellow, and pink and purple(?). There may be more categories for flowers because there's too many of them lol.   

Omg I'd freak out once I noticed it was the wrong product. And my dumb body would probably create hives or something to make me think I actually *did* have a problem with it. But it's great that you're not experiencing any adverse effects so far :o  

I've given up on understanding the reasons for why certain fragrant ingredients do or don't make my skin tick. It really does end up being something that requires personal testing to determine. And I'd normally tell people not to tempt fate, but you've already gone and done so multiple times already ~~so what's the harm in doing so again~~ 🤣 Just make sure to have some soothing things on hand...just in case.  

I *do* want to note that both instances are wash-off products though, which presumably would carry less chances of irritation because they don't remain in contact with your skin beyond 1-3 minutes at best. The fragrance is at the end of the ingredients list for the serum, so there's less concern but still...",5
긍정,"This is a good point, I didn’t even make the connection that both are wash off products!  

Oh I *did* freak out about it.  I’m all sanguine now only because it ended up not being a problem lololololol.

I use Biodance bifida cream (awesome Korean cream), which has a floral scent, and le meiux essence moisturizer (also awesome) which smells like rich old ladies.  So far, so good.  Fingers crossed though.  

I remember reading that fragrance 1 and fragrance 2 are specific combos that cause irritation.  They are listed by that name.  

But you are right, it’s a shot in the dark trying to figure out what’s what.  I truly believe using a bucket of bifida on my face daily has made my skin ridiculously resilient.  I mean, I’ve basically been exfoliating the hell out of for two weeks (unknowingly) and it’s only started to protest.  In the past, I would have been in deep trouble.  I use bifida like a medication for my skin, I never go without it.  Maybe it will afford me some measure of protection because dammit I’m getting that decorte 😂😂",2
중립,"Do let me know what you think when you get it 😂  

Yeah...limonene and linalool are pretty common components in a bunch of fragrant extracts...and it sucks because you can't really tell if it'll freak out out this time or not. Kind of like how some people react poorly to squalene from sharks but are fine with olive oil sourced squalene or vice versa. (Probably a terrible example, but I just wanted to speculate that maybe the origin of the fragrant extract matters too?)  

Bifida is definitely amazing :)  
I'd like to see more brands utilize it. Definitely have also observed some level of resilience on my end as well :o

Crazy curious about the grey MSH/&be eyeliner. I don’t think the grey would look good on my skin tone; I really love Dolly wink’s griege though, so I know grey tones can look great on skin.

That AmorePacific cream is so pretty 😭

And honestly I don’t understand how Amway is so big in Japan. I had a friend who was “working with” Amway a few years back and she was surprise I’d never heard of them. Because they sold them so BS about being a big, trusted American company 🙄

Re: the Taiwan cream news, I’m curious about how a 3 year old could start their period. I don’t understand how biologically that would even work. I wonder if they cycle stops after using the cream.

긍정,"I wrote a journal [here](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/ux63z8), but my hair tonics are what I consider my main preventatives. I'm a very dehydrated person, so I think of the tonics like a toner for my scalp, since toners are my favorite skincare step. The Skylake Tonic is full of hangbangy herbs that has been great at keeping my scalp's oiliness in check. The Oribe Scalp Thickening Spray I felt like it helped encourage more baby hairs when I wrote the journal, and I've kept using it to give me hair some good ingredients. The way I feel about it now is that I can't really tell if it's continuing to work, but I'm kind of afraid it's one of those ""you don't notice it's working until you stop it"" products so it's staying around. I have a few more backups, but I might think about an actual scalp serum if I continue to feel this way. 

I've yet to look into scalp scalers, and I kind of dragging my feet on it. I feel like my Skylake shampoo is pretty good at stripping my scalp of oily buildup, but the water where I live is pretty hard so I can't say for sure that it's removing additional mineral buildup. I think a scalp scaler would give me a better idea if the Skylake is doing what I think it is. I probably will try it next year, but I'm in the middle of trying other things right now.",1
긍정,"I live in a super hard-water area too.  Have you tried club soda?  I keep a bottle in the shower.  It’s great for removing a bit of the deposits from hair, and it always makes my hair fluffy again in between chelating shampoos.  

Also, sorry for the non-ab rec, but redken chelating shampoo is absolutely wonderful.  I only use it once in a blue moon because I have very short hair, but it does a nice reset with minimal dryness.",4
긍정,"Club soda is an interesting thought I’ll try to bring myself to do it. I tried that whole rice water thing and hated it, so I know I’m going to be really lazy about getting club soda to rinse my hair. I know there’s like zero effort by comparison, but I’ve also been playing around with my hair and testing product so much I’m pretty close to being done 😂 haircare is not nearly as fun as skincare for me. 

I tried a few non-AB shampoos since my journal and I’m just kind of tired of trying for now, especially since I I love the Ryo Cheonsamhwa shampoo and Skylake ones so much, and have been grateful I even found shampoos that I do like so much (haircare continues to be a mystery to me), but I’ll keep it in mind. Thanks! It might not be something I revisit again until 2024 thought 😅",2

I ordered from MissBeautyKorea! I live in France and I was impressed by how fast the shipping was! It took around 1 week to arrive but I waited 1 week after I placed my order to be sent.
When I thought they had an issue with my order because it wasn't shipped yet, I contacted their customer service. They answered in a span of a night (due to the timezone I guess!) and the next day, everything was solved.
 
The products selection is smaller but the prices are also cheaper than Yesstyle. 

If you are interested into Japanese skincare, there is also Kokoro Japan! I bought my stock of Hada Labo Prenium lotion+essdnce there at a nice price.

Both of my orders from these sites didn't come with surprise taxes (YESSS) but I wonder if I'll get them next time ahah...",1
중립,"I don't have a different way to apply both of them. I usually apply two layers of them and be done ahah. What I can tell to help you pick between the two formulas is the JLT is thicker and the color is more satured than the WGT.

Hope that helps :)",1

I'm excited now! Thank you!",1

Hopefully, you will have the same experience as me with  Missbeautykorea. It's so nice to finally have a site where I didn't need to check if something was in stock!

You will love Kokoro Japan for sure :)",1
긍정,"I know I was a bit disappointed especially since I expressed my disappointment to them more than once and I had partnered with the site for sponsorships as well which is extra odd. The order was a personal purchase ..but my other personal purchase I made went okay so I'm not sure..they just kept sending me generic emails blaming everything on covid. And then like a couple weeks late a person would email me saying something similar about covid and that my order coming.  Much less friendly dealings than when it was partnerships. Not cool. 

Thanks so much for the recommendations I think I've heard of kokoro Japan now that I really think about it, but maybe just from seeing the name around on message boards. 
Oh you've got me all excited! Haha!

Hmm other than hada labo what are some other of your fav Japanese brands?? I love me some canmake mermaid skin uv gel but other than those brands I don't think I know much else? Not that come to mind anyways?",1
긍정,"Wow. 
I am wondering if they forgot they did a partnership with you and that's why they treated you this way? That's crappy anyway, it doesn't matter if someone was sponsored or is a simple customer, they should be professionals. At least, offer some compensation because that's 4 entire months of waiting!

I know that some packages can be lost but I read it too many times with Stylevana. Some people never get an asnwer to their inquiries!

My pleasure, for once I can share something useful haha. I can't tell you how I was anxious when I placed my order on Kokoro Japan because there was no review around! But I am glad I did it!
Just read their notices before ordering anyhing. With the war in Ukraine, shipping to France is complicated and may result to lost packages. But if nothing is written for Canada then you're good!

I only tried Hada Labo...When the shipping to France will go back to normal, I want to try Kiku Masamune Sake brand. It's affordable and BIGGER sized than Hada Labo lotion and essence ahah.",1
중립,"Yeah, I'm sure it's a different team that deals with the partnerships vs actual customers anyways but yes should be treated the same. Also, the partnerships were not during covid so maybe the covid situation really did have a serious impact but still. I feel bad for the folks who never get answers and just lose out. Mine wasn't a huge order but it was $88 so I would've been upset on losing out on that. I mean it's not pocket change. I always use PayPal for any of these types of purchases just incase so at least they are good in those regards. 

I want to try Kiku masamune  sake also!  I was reading g some ingredients though and I saw some fragrance stuff I wasn't excited about and I think something else but I forget what..but you never know till you try lol!!",2
중립,"Totally, 88$ is still a big amount of money. I spent 91$, shipping fees included, for my last haul so I get you. I also try to use Paypal as much as I can. If I can't then no way I'll order anything.

I used to buy from TesterKorea where I always waited 3 weeks before getting my package. I stopped when they only offered high fee shipping due to Covid. I tried to come back but the product selection was...bleh ahah.

Dang, I didn't know there was fragrance :/ you're right about trying but my skin is sensitive and I finally have eczema under control. So I can't risk a reaction.

The others have all been sealed with stickers, shrink wrap, or are packaged in a way that makes it pretty easy to tell if it’s been tampered with. 

Anyone could still get a fake, but it’s not as common these days as it was even a year ago. Amazon seems to be taking steps to implement a verification system, such as what [Missha’s Time Revolution FTE listing is talking about](https://a.co/d/ax50Ziu).

https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8i98qq/discussion_psa_reminder_that_amazon_does_not/

Mind, I’m not saying there isn’t a problem with individual sellers; there absolutely is. I’m simply saying that if you buy a product from, say, the COSRX seller account, you are getting a product from their inventory, not anyone else’s. (Worth noting that some brands use Amazon as an official retailer. They would not risk this if they couldn’t keep their inventory separate.)

If one orders from a legitimate seller and got a fake, it’s possible there was an issue *with that seller’s inventory or sourcing*, or that the product wasn’t fake but off for some other reason (I’ve mentioned this before, but I once got a Deciem product from Deciem with visible mold. It happens.) I do know the above is still true.",20

긍정,"I’m from the southeastern US, where hellish heat and humidity abound.

First, keep your moisturizer/sunscreen to a lighter consistency. Anything heavy will be sweated off, along with any makeup you applied overtop of it, and people *will* notice that your face is literally melting. Learn from my mistakes.

Second, keep your makeup light as well, but not so light that it’s useless to you. Tinted moisturizers/sunscreens and BB creams are your friends, full-on foundation is risky. If your tinted products/BB creams are insufficient, use concealer to cover up anything they don’t cover well enough. You can also apply powder, but honestly, best to do this sparingly and only in areas where your oil production is high. I do my T-zone only. If you get sweaty and then cool off, too much powder can make your makeup look cakey and streaky.



Products I use in the AM are:

Moisturizer: Eucerin Q10 lotion

Sunscreen: A‘Pieu Pure Block

BB cream: Missha Perfect Cover

중립,"Of course! It is medium coverage but can be buildable. I usually tend to use either sponge or brush depending on what I have washed and ready to use. However, there was a time when I was in a rush and took my makeup to do in the car and realized I forgot my sponge and brush so I applied it with my fingers. Honestly I think it might’ve looked more flawless applying it this way than with any of my brushes or sponge. Shade matching was what had kept me from purchasing because they don’t have a variety of colors. I went into Neiman Marcus and the sales person provided me with the two sample colors so that I can try it out for a couple of days. I am olive skin tone and use 123. When applied at first it looks a little lighter than my skin color and within about 5 minutes it adapts to my skin color.

It reminds me of very fine powder sugar. I don't even have another loose powder to compare it to because I don't think it is comparable to other brands. I use the translucent one. There was also a different option of highlighting powder and it had tiny glitter in it. When I sampled it in my hand it looked gorgeous and something to wear to a special event, but I have acne scars and feel like glitter makes my scars more visible, so I just purchased the regular one.

긍정,"**sensual powder matte tint** in **499 rosy suede**

this is a formula that requires fussing. if you're not fussy about a perfect application, you may apply it as per normal, but the formula does not smooth and adhere evenly by itself, especially with the attached applicator -- it needs to be blotted down, sheered, and 'fixed' to the lips with a fingertip.

once applied properly though, it's quite a lovely tint. a delicate thin formula that sets to the lips like an airy powder-matte veil that gives that soft-focus blurred finish, and isn't too drying - it makes the lips look very full and soft and smooth. it lasts well and wears off acceptably elegantly, and if applied properly, doesn't transfer. because it needs to be set, pigmentation is not as intense as a swatch; you can layer up quite smoothly but that might impact transfer-ability. it has a slightly silicone-y slippery quality before it sets down, and applies beautifully as blush on the cheeks as well.

499 rosy suede is a mutable mlbb-type colour that can shift between a muted dusky rose-brown and a warm mlbb with brickish/terracotta red undertones, strongly erring on the side of the red (esp if you lean cool-toned like me), depending on lighting and your skintone.


**sensual spicy nude gloss** in **422 lingerie**

the applicator of this is quite unique - it only carries a little bit of product at a time, and the formula is quite rich - this might not suit everyone's preferences, but i find it's great for helping you make sure it's adhered really well to the lips and to make sure you don't go overboard, so it's also easy to get a gradiation if you want to.

the pigmentation is semi-opaque while maintaining that transparent watery quality; the formula is quite thick, and has a very glassy, juicy finish; it has a faint minty cooling feeling and the shine lasts a couple of hours before fading into a softly glowy, light wash of colour. i find it's pretty moisturizing and the formula adheres REALLY well to the lips without being too sticky, which i really enjoy, since it won't smudge and move around too easily.

422 is a brighter baby coral pink colour, a very pretty spring tone that instantly gives porcelain doll vibes, that sort of effortlessly beautiful fairylike energy. it's a little milky, best for lighter skintones.",22
긍정,"Skin type: normal to dry, hyperpigmentation concerns. 

The GREAT: 

**Hera cell bio essence.** This does not have any ferments in it, but it's a great brightening first essence. I think it's great price for what you get. It's less expensive than SKII. I've RP

**Hera sensual spicy nude gloss in red lie:** it's a neutral, not too warm red. It does seem to make my lips appear more fuller. I just it on top of lipsticks, tints, etc. I'd RP. 

**Hera rosy statin cream**. RP and love. It absorbs very quickly, and provides great water oil balance. 

**Hera sun mate protector spf 50**: this absorbs quickly, but has a little bit of shiny feel to it. It has a beige tint to it, but no white cast. It's a hybrid spf w the asian chemical filters and titanium dioxide. Would RP if I didn't have so many spf on deck. 

**hera brow  designer auto pencil in 33 brown** \- very natural looking, and helps you fill in your brows. I've bought 3 of these and would probably have continued buying this if I had not discovered romand han all flat brow in grace taupe. which is a perfect dupe for this hera pencil and $10 instead of $19. 

The BAD:

**Hera UV mist cushion** \- it just did not disappear well. I ended up giving away my cushion to a friend. 

**Hera black foundation** \- great oil control and looks perfect for the first 7-8 hours. BUt after that, it disappears in a patchy way. Not a RP. 

The MEH/OK: 

 **Hera white effector serum**. I've used a full bottle of this, and I thought it was brightening until I tried SKII and other vitamin c serums. This is not a RP. 

**Hera magic starter in lavender and mint:** it's very lightly color correcting. it's too thin to really do heavy duty color correcting. But if you're looking for a thin summer primer to color correct just a little, this would work for you.",7

* The finish is matte but still quite skin-like; given my skin type, I find it to work best with hydrating/non-matte SPFs (I don't use primers).
* If you have dry skin, be sure to moisturise well/exfoliate as it tends to emphasize dry patches, especially when you're wearing a mask.
* Compared to the previous formula, the 2021 formula has less coverage but looks more forgiving on textures and imperfection. I find the longevity to be improved too.

긍정,"Definitely will get it now, I was worried it’d cake up and crease (don’t have wrinkles, just smile a lot and make up tend to crease) plus I’m glad it’s good for dry skin",3
긍정,I have it and love it at the beginning of the day but it becomes very patchy as the day goes on…did that happen to someone else?,1
중립,Do you have the old formulation of the Sensual Powder Matte? Minsco did a video on a reformulation a month or two ago where she talked about how it's not oily anymore and they've improved the texture so I'm curious what the new formula is like before I plunk down $36.,5
중립,I am dry skin and I am using the glow lasting cushion of Hera. I think the black cushion is better for oily or combination skin,3
중립,I used 21n which fit me fine. Just a tad pale. It doesn’t disappear as prettily as bb creams on me. Very glowy and pretty for the first 5 hours.,3
긍정,"13N is a really great shade match for me. I'm very pale. Very glowy but takes powder well.  Fragrance. Thin consistency.  I was surprised how well it worked for me,  esp the shade because I was kind of guessing.",2
긍정,It’s very underrated. I love it so much and I already bought it three times. 17N1 is the color I am using. I have dry skin and last me more than 7 hours,2
중립,Do you know your MAC shade? Or any other western brand?,1
중립,What happens after 5 hours?,1
중립,Do you know your mac match? Or any other western brand?,1
중립,"I’m nc15. I wear 00 in Guerlain parure gold foundation.  00N in Guerlain lessentiel radiant foundation, surratt dew drop foundation in 2, Lancome teint idole foundation in B-01.",1
중립,"it breaks up around my nose. It looks oily, and I have to blot and use a qtip to clean up the area.",2
긍정,I haven't had much luck with western brands to be honest.. The signature perfect missha bb in 13 (purple bottle) is a pretty good match for me.,2
중립,"Nars chantilly is an ok match, a bit light so I mix it with one of the slightly darker shades",1
중립,I guess it's a mess if we wear a mask?,1
긍정,"Yes, under a mask it didn't look great. I could see this working for me better if mixed with a matte foundation. I have Lancome teint idole foundation, which is more matte for summer. I'm going to try it together.",1
부정,That sounds kinda disappointing. I have a glowy cushion from Vely Vely. The finish is glowy but it stays very well under a mask,1
중립,"I feel if you use their makeup mist, that should be better to hold the makeup. That’s how I put the mist after the foundation",1
긍정,"Thanks for your hard work! 

It baffles me that AB brands pretend like oily skin doesn’t exist. We have enough dewy, glowy, moisture sunscreens. For the love of god, release more matte sunscreens 😭",62
긍정,Doing god’s work. Thank you so much.,11
중립,"Is it because KBeauty brands count on their customers to not care about or read ingredients list? 

Because that's a lot of duplicate sunscreens...

Makes me wonder what other popular products are just white labeled versions of cheaper products.",18
긍정,I appreciate your posts very much! The lagom option looks good but haven't had any of their products before,6
중립,"Lol i am really confused about the mary & may sunscreen. Some retailers have the ingredients list with zinc oxide only, and then the official packaging and website say its a chemical sunscreen (both english and korean), and also, the official packaging also lists fragrance just above carbomer (from the naver posts that i saw), whereas the official korean website ingredients list has fragrance at the bottom of the ingredients list, maybe bc of different ingredients list laws in korea…. lol idk anymore its confusing.",5

so my best sunscreen currently is B.lab I Am Sorry Just Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++  
I bought 3 of them and it was my best sunscreen everbut  when I want to repurchase today, the product is nowhere to be found apparently its on of the sunscreen that have purito gate scandal :( sadge",2

중립,it breaks my heart the missha aqua sun gel reformulation is now a dewy finish :( was my holy grail sunscreen and i hoped the reformulation wouldn’t be too different,13
긍정,"There’s an American sunscreen I use for the cloudier northern hemisphere months that has kaolin clay in it and it’s amazing.  It’s marketed as a primer and I am able to use a full ml because it’s so soft and comfortable.  It’s broad spectrum but it’s only SPF 20 and has none of the newer filters of course.  

I would love to see a good AB sunscreen formulated with kaolin or equivalent mattifyer!",3
중립,I feel your pain 🥹,2
중립,"There was a whole thing about this. Actually, that a lot of the foundational formulations are designed by the manufacturers. Not the brand selling it. The brand selling it might add/remove different ingredients at different percentages. Like customizing it.",15

중립,I bought it so I’ll make sure to follow up. Tracking says it arrives Friday!,3
중립,">I'm having the same issue :( I stocked up on the B Lab I am Sorry Just Sun Cream and still have 2 left. I'm surprised they don't expire for a couple more years. I wishhh there was a sunscreen like it currently. The Keep Cool Soothe Sunscreen was even better imo. Why couldn't they just keep producing the same formulations but lower SPF claim on the bottle :l

&#x200B;

Currently still searching for a replacment. I have sensitive, reactive, rosacea skin so it's hard. I might try the new Klairs All Day Airy Sunscreen.

&#x200B;

Ingredients I avoid in sunscreens: oil, parabens, alcohol, fragrance, essential oils, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, decyl glucoside (causes contact dermatitis).",2
중립,hii can you update us on the sunscreen?,1
중립,"I have dry, rosacea skin. AFAIK, I'm not allergic to anything, but I'd like to avoid potentially irritating ingredients. Do you mind sharing what sunscreens you use? A lot of sunscreens I like have decyl glucoside (Beauty of Joseon, Round Lab, Isntree, Skin1004, etc).",1
긍정,Yes! This INCI is correct - it’s chemical. It’s also really nice; a little less on the dewy side than BOJ/Isntree.,2

PS: Soon Jung also has a ""Mild"" sunscreen thats in a white bottle. I have not tried it since it's a mineral based sunscreen (I have tan skin, so a white cast is not ideal)",2
긍정,Thank you! I really want to try it now. Do you know if it’s been verified? Is it true to its SPF rating?,1
긍정,"So sorry I don’t know how to find that out :/

If it helps tho, I bought mine from stylekorean-best price I could find! Their deals on the brand are great",2
긍정,"Meh, gives a greasy look instead of glow. Idk what’s going on but they’ve discontinued a few cushion that were really good and then making new mediocre ones :/",13
긍정,"Old formula was AMAZING! The first foundation is liked in over 10 years.. I bought the new one and hate it. The finish is greasy now. Before it would first apply to matte looking but within an hour I looked like a porcelain doll. Airbrushed perfect foundation that didn’t need touch ups all day. New finish needs touch ups within two-three hours and looks cakey. Also loved the fragrance in the old one. It honestly breaks my heart because I’ve been searching for the perfect foundation for over 10 years. Finally found it last year and then they changed it
This is about the black cushion!",3
중립,How is this cushion new?,2
중립,Controversial (maybe) but cushion makeup seems a smidgen too unhygienic for me,2
중립,"it’s not new, but i believe it’s reformulated! they’ve reformulated their black cushion as well :)",11
중립,"Yep I agree (and I’m a loyal cushion user lol), you’re supposed to wash/switch out the sponge as often as you would a brush but most people don’t. But as long as you do that and only apply on a clean face then it’s fine.",3
중립,"Understandable, that is why I like metal cushions. I am still sad the vdl one is so hard to track down now.",3
중립,"Why are you getting downvoted lol, it literally is the most unhygienic form of base makeup. I mean I still use it because there's preservatives in it so it's safe to use... but like it's unhygienic",5
중립,"Huh, really? I had no idea 
The cover glow of the uv is my fav",1
긍정,"oh really? it stinks when companies reformulate products we already love 😩

but i’ve heard mostly good things about the new ones, so hopefully you like them too! :)",1
긍정,"I've been on the hunt for the perfect MLBB tint for a while now and wanted to share some of my successes and failures.

In the pursuit of the perfect MLBB I found a few shades that aren't MLBB but did become HGs despite that. Peripera's Ink Airy Stick in Daily Rose my absolutely favorite. I just keep coming back to it. It doesn't pull orange on me, I find it falls somewhere between a rosey pink and a brick red. The formula is very drying, but it's easily combat with a little chapstick before application. I also like Sundried Rose which is very similar but more red/orange. 

Peripera's Ink Mood Matte in Ginger Red is nice. The formula is sheer, but layerable and not too drying. Light application works for me for everyday, but of I apply too much it's too orange. I really love the formula though and I hope they come out with more colors.

As far as actual MLBBs, the Hera Sensual Powder Matte is the best I've found. It's a little darker than I'd like, but the formula feels really smooth and velvety. It is not drying. My friend said she couldn't tell I was wearing anything, just thought I looked healthy. Romand's Jujube and Rose Splash tints are also great true MLBBs and more hydrating, it probably helps that they are fairly sheer.

And now for the tints that just didn't hit: Etude House's Analogue Rose is straight up orange on me, and Soft Walnut is just too dark/brown. Romand's Zero Velvet in Joyful is also basically an orange tint on my coloring.",7
긍정,do you think that hera's rosy suede is a true neutral or leaning more warm/cool? i'm debating whether or not to get it since i'm also on the hunt for the perfect AB MLBB. thanks for sharing your swatches!,4
긍정,"thanks for sharing! Those colors look gorgeous on you and I could see even the duds looking nice for an autumny vibe. 

If you do like the Ink Mood Matte formula you might enjoy the shade Oatmeal Rose - it's still leans coral but has more pink in it than the Ginger red.",6
중립,"I'm new to makeup in general and also trying to find a MLBB tint! I got Peripera's Sundried Rose and liked how bright it was, but it still looked warm and orange on me. Would you still suggest Daily Rose? I know the swatches are right there but the top two look the same to me D:",2
중립,I’ve been really curious about Romand’s Glasting Water tints. Is it like a lip gloss or balm? Or is the texture different from either?,1
긍정,"Oh gosh, that's a really hard question! I'm not great at assessing the warmth/coolness of colors. I actually just ran to put it on and see if that would change what I was thinking. After spending some time staring at it in the mirror I think it's a pretty true neutral if not slightly warm. But again, I am not great at warm/cool.",2
중립,"Okay I actually JUST got Peripera Mood Matte Stick in Rose Fiction in the mail today. It's a little warmer and lighter in color than Hera, but I feel like it's a true MLBB ""just looks like lips"" look + it's cheaper than Hera. You might want to try that if slightly warm tints suit you!",2
중립,"I'll check it out, thanks for the rec!",2
긍정,"They are definitely super similar. I love Daily Rose, it has the same brightness as Sundried Rose but it's a little more on the pink side vs. red. If you liked Sundried Rose I think Daily Rose will be a winner too, but I don't know if it'll be an MLBB. I get a lot of compliments on Daily Rose when I wear it, but people are definitely more in the ""wow I love that lipstick on you"" camp, not ""wow that looks like your regular lips, but better""",1
중립,"It is like a lip gloss with a little more staying power than other glosses I've tried. Definitely more gloss than balm, but if you blot your lips it'll still give you the color with a more subdued shine.",2
중립,thanks for getting back to me! i prefer lippies that are true neutral or leaning slightly cool so i'll check out hera's rosy suede. it's hard to find AB lip tints that are on the less saturated/muted side but rosy suede seems to be a staple for a lot of people so i'm excited to see what the hype is about!!,1
중립,"Anything that promises matte, long wear and/or heavy coverage will inevitably sink into texture and wrinkles, especially if you have drier/dehydrated skin, even with all the prep in the world unless you have oilier skin. 

Maybe look into more hydrating formulas? I don’t use face products much but I like the Innisfree Light Fit Cushion.",21

긍정,"[Purito Cica BB cream](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JCK7LSN/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apan_glt_fabc_A9NMG1EYJ1A64ZT8K8BQ) is my HG foundation, and I have tried a hell of a lot, both western and AB. 

I have an autoimmune disorder that makes my skin very flushed and uneven , and while AB has been a huge help, I still have flares that are triggered by things like weather, stress, etc.

I used to wear full coverage foundation even though it emphasized fine lines and texture, because well, it beat looking like I was cosplaying a lobster. Never had luck with any BB or CC creams (red *and* textured, yay). But I love Purito's Cica Ampoules, so when I saw that they had a Cica BB Cream for only $9 USD, I thought I would try it for wearing at home or for when my skin was too irritated to wear regular makeup.

I received it when my skin was looking pretty rough and tried it on not expecting much, but it did a great job of covering texture and redness, making my skin look really smooth and even. Despite having good coverage, it's very light and looks surprisingly natural. I don't get that heavy, creased look that I got with other foundations. It's not as matte as a lot of products are, so you might want to use a very light dusting of translucent powder, but I think it will depend on your skin type. I've gotten tons of compliments since I started using it, and my mom has gotten some, as well (spreading the AB addiction lol).

When applying, a little goes a long way, I'm used to needing quite a bit for coverage, but it's really not necessary with this BB cream. The undertone looks a bit different than other foundations I've used, and it seems to be especially effective for covering redness. I dot on a very thin layer with my fingers and then apply a bit more to any areas that look uneven. It lasts all day for me, and I haven't had any problems with transferring or irritation, however I can't wear a mask because of my disorders, so that's not something I can comment on.

The only downside is that there's only 3 shades. I normally wear a 21 in Korean foundation, MAC shade NW18, and their lightest shade, N21, is perfect for me.",8
긍정,"Same - I've had this problem with every BB I've tried (admittedly that was before I knew about AB). I've also got a lot of texture to my skin / large pores / CCs. I'd be really interested to see people's responses so commenting, although I have nothing helpful to add! 

I have been using mineral foundation (nonAB) which doesn't cover but doesn't emphasise these issues, except that it changes colour (lightens) on my face in a couple of hours so this isn't great either!!",8
중립,"You can try the canmake bb cream, only sad thing is that it has two shades 
It does get into the mask though",3
중립,"Klaars supple blemish cream , but sometimes for me it pills and btw that was the closest to natural that you could get.  Btw now adays I use my skin as my foundation (no products just skincare",3
긍정,"The matte thing might be it because I’m trying to pile on hydration and drink water. I try my best to apply as little liquid also with my beauty sponge because I want a “barely there” kind of look. The matte look seems to be in nowadays from covid, as it really wasn’t a thing when I was here before and had none of these problems. Does the Innisfree cushion have SPF?",2
중립,"This could absolutely be it! When I was here before, the glowy dewy look was in and I never had the problem with anything I tried. I still pile on the hydration and using dewy setting spray, but it could totally be the matte formula. I’ll definitely have to check out Klairs.",2
중립,Ooooh the klairs is on sale on wishtrend at the moment!,2

중립,"I bought it directly in the store so it was 16,000 won or like..$13. It has a light flower perfume but scents never bothered me so I’m not sure if it’d be too much or bothersome to someone else.",1
중립,"Not ab except for the concealer but, I used to use the nyx bare with me tinted skin veil and bourjois foundation(i like the nyx more tho, bourjois kinda leans too warm on me).

I eventually stopped using foundation and just stuck with the luna concealer for problem areas.",10

긍정,"Great review, thanks for sharing your cushion comparison!

Personally my fave combo for mask makeup is Anessa UV Milk + Hera Black Cushion + powder. Powdery matte that doesn't stick to mask, no stickiness in humidity, and very minimal transfer!

I have the old Hera Black Cushion and the fragrance lingers after application, do you find this to be the case too for the fragrance in the renewed version?",24
긍정,This is awesome - thanks for the detail. Your list of most matte and most coverage was awesome. This is such a thorough review!,11
긍정,"Thanks for the reviews!! I totally agree with them from my own experience with Hera Black (sooo amazing — but I have the old one, not the 2021 release), Laneige (again, the old ones, not the neo releases), and Sulwhasoo (I have the brightening and the original perfecting one, both of which are overhyped and SO expensive). I haven’t tried the YSL one but looks like I won’t need to :)

If you like hera black you should check out the Giorgio Armani cushions! Also another one of my favs, especially if you’re into the natural, semi-matte finish and full coverage.",7
중립,May you recommend some retailers in USA that carry the Hera Black Cushion?,5
중립,[deleted],5
긍정,"Thank you for the detailed review! 

I appreciate that you mention your skincare base and the powder that you use on top because I find that it also affects how well the cushion sits & lasts. My usual routine is toner, serum, moisturizer, and SPF and I try to let everything sink in before I do my foundation but I feel like it still never last more than 4-5 hrs before it starts to break down. I always powder my T zone since I have combo skin but yeah I've trying to find ways to make it last longer.

I also have the Laneige Neo Cushion Matte in Shade 23N and I agree with your review! I also find that it tends to cling to any dry patches on my face so I wasn't very pleased. Also, my cushion doesn't seem very 'wet' compared to the other ones I have. I hope that mine isn't drying out already because I barely used it 10 times?

For the Eglips Blur Powder Pact, does the shade matter because I'd imagine it to be a translucent powder? Does it mattify as well? Thanks again!",4
긍정,"Great review! 
I’ve been using Laneige hydra radiance shade 21 for a while now, since it’s been discontinued I’ve been searching for a new BB. 
From your review I think I’ll enjoy the espoir one! Thank you!",3
긍정,This was such a good review!! I was really leaning towards purchasing the Laneige ones but not so much anymore lol. By the way where did you purchase the ysl one?,2
중립,"If anyone has tried the Espoir Be Silk, Be Powder or Taping Cover Cushions. I'd also like to know your experiences as they may be the next ones I'm considering.",1
긍정,does the espoir cushion make you feel oily and greasy? i have oily skin but i love dewy finish looks,1
중립,Hi which shade should i use for Hera black if i uses jsm ‘medium’ shade? I was think Hera n21 or n23?,1
긍정,i'm finding it increasingly hard to find the black hera cushion and wondering if you have any new HGs because we seem to like the same thing! hehe thank you,1
긍정,"Thank you for the review and the swatches! I am a Laneige 21N, and it works best for my skin (oily/combination skin living in tropical climate). I also flush quite often especially when laughing or during the sudden rise of temp. I wanted to try JSM. Is it still worth the buy with my current conditions?",1
긍정,"Thank you for the reviews - agree with the ones that I’ve tried, although I had a worse  impression of the Espoir! I’ve been eyeing the YSL cushions for some time but the price has put me off so far. Interesting to hear about the Neo Glow issue - I have the Matte and am quite happy with it, but am in search of a glowy  option and hoped Glow would be good - maybe not after reading your review! I also have Hera Black and have to agree it’s amazing! I prefers less matte look but it looks so natural! It’s become my daily cushion (the price still makes me sad though).",1
긍정,"Hi OP, thanks for the review. Which cushion shade matches your skin the best? I’m interested in Laneige Neo Matte and you said the colour ended up oxidising on you to a few shades darker, is that right?",1
중립,"Thanks for the detailed review, was waiting to find one from the Hera Cushion with the new formulation! 

Oh and now that you mentioned your skincare routine, would you mind sharing it? I’ve been trying to find inspiration in highly moisturising routines and products as I might be moving back to my home country soon and the weather there is incredibly dry so I think my skin will need that extra hydration very soon.",1
중립,What’s your all time favorite matte cushion?,1
중립,"Thanks for the review ! I’ve been trying to find a cushion without niacinamide and the Hera one is the only one I saw. It sounds like we have similar skin tones too, so now I have a vague idea of what shade to get.",1
긍정,Love your review! Which cushion would you say is the most pore blurring?,1
중립,"The new Hera cushion has a light floral scent that I stop noticing after a while. I am not too sensitive to the smell, but I would say it's definitely milder than Laneige's. To be honest, if you can stand the citrus scent from the Anessa, I think you should be fine haha.",5
중립,"Thanks! I find that generally speaking, Korean cushions aren't really matte compared to their western counterparts so most cushions labeled as matte are more-semi matte. I'm looking forward to trying out more matte AB cushions.",3
중립,I have heard about it and am curious to try out. I just haven't been able to take the plunge yet as it's double the price of the other AB cushions. I'm curious to try out the Espoir Taping cover cushion though which seems to be even more matte (supposedly).,1
중립,i heard the new laneige formula is worse. i like the old formula but i haven't try the new formula.,1
중립,"I'm not from the US, so I wouldn't know which retailers have it in stock. Maybe some others can help you.",5
중립,"I'm not sure where you are, but Laneige Neo has shades 31N, 35N and 35N in South East Asia. From just googling swatches, 31N or 35N might work for you?",3
중립,"Laneige Neo Matte seems dryer because the puff is firmer and denser, so you'll need to press on it hard to get the product out. It's not like the other cushions where you can easily have too much product on your puff.

The Eglips Blur Powder Pact has better oil control and more matifying properties compared to the Canmake Marshmallow. Color shouldn't be an issue, but you may look a bit paler if you overdo the powder.",4
중립,"I'm not really sure if Petal is the exact match for me yet. On paper, the swatch seems to look like the lightest all the cushions I own. So if you lean a bit netural to a warm 21, I think Beige may be a better fit.",3
중립,I got it at the makeup counters in the airport and then the department stores. It doesn't seem readily available online.,1
중립,Espoir be glow might be too oily for you. I find it doesn’t last long and will break if mixed with excessive oils. Maybe the espoir be natural may work better if you don’t mind the light coverage. It’s less greasy feeling too.,1
중립,Im a light in jsm cushions. I recently swatched 23n and 23c Hera blacks and they’re still within my shade. I think if you’re a jsm medium you might be better with 23n or even darker,1
중립,I’m planning on doing a part 2 of this review soon. These days I prefer a more natural coverage and finish. You might want to consider the JSM masterclass or espoir be natural.,1
긍정,"The price for the Hera cushions are roughly the same as the Laneige's. YSL is double the price, and Espoir is about 70% of the price of Laneige/Hera with discounts.

If you really like the strobe-glow look, the Neo Glow may be a good option. Both Neos seem to wear quite awkwardly on me compared to others though so I may be a bit biased.",3
중립,"The Neo Matte in shade 23N applied like a true 21N and then oxidized into a shade 23-24. Since reviews said 21 was way too bright, I was hoping 23N appeared closer to 22N, but it wasn't the case.",3
긍정,I use a lot of hyaluronic acid from Hada Labo. It might not be good for dry weather tbh.,1
긍정,Probably the Hera Cushion. It looks the best after a full day of wear. You don’t get that ugly nose crust. Though tbh I wouldn’t call most Korean cushions true matte.,2
중립,thanks for the tip! yeah i think beige would be better for me,1
긍정,thank you so much for replying!! espoir be glow is off of my list then,1
중립,Thanks,1
중립,Where are you buying the Hera that it's the same price as Laneige? I'm often finding Hera charging luxury prices.,3
긍정,Thank you!,1

I wish there was just one product that we could rely on for brightening without irritation/use of acids.

I have used both Skinceuticals CE Ferulic(expensive) and melano CC(way cheaper), In terms of brightening, melano cc was much more brightening and I feel like it's much more stable, but they do make my skin much more sensitive.",2

긍정,"Happy to see this review. I don’t see a lot of reviews for Hera. I have 23W in this foundation and NC25 in Mac waterweight. I chose the W because I have a warmer undertones. However, in their black cushion, I am in shade 25. They don’t have warm tones in their cushions. I almost bought 25N in the foundation but I found another review mentioned that the shade is not similar to their black cushions, and it leaned more pinkish. Happy with my 23W, I agree, it looks better to apply them in light layers. Can tend to be heavy with full pump.",7
긍정,"Thank you for the review! Sorry to bother you with more questions:    

Have you tried the Hera cushion foundation and if yes, how does it compare to the liquid foundation shade-wise and finish-wise?    

For someone who normally wears a 23 neutral in Korean foundation, do you think I should get 23N1 in the Hera foundation or go a shade lighter (21N1)?   

The foundation looks a tad orange(?) on my monitor after oxidizing, does it still blend well into your skin?",3
중립,Thanks for the review! Wow the oxidisation is pretty strong,2
중립,I live in malaysia tropical humid wheather. I wore 21N shade and about 2 hour later it oxidize to one shade darker. Maybe need to wear primer to make it last longer,1

중립,I have shade 23W in Hera Black foundation and 23N in the cushion. Does the foundation oxidise on you?,2
긍정,"No worries! I'm happy to answer.

I haven't tried the Hera cushion foundation. I really want to, but it's hard to get ahold of at a reasonable price sadly. :(

It's hard to say because 23N really does vary by product- however, I've found a very helpful video by Saerom Min that actually uses the Black Foundation as a standard to compare other #23 products which may be helpful to you: [link](https://youtu.be/dDO3Bxmr9gA?t=1317). I do think that generally, it's true to shade.

If you look at the picture of the Black Foundation vs the MAC NC25 foundation, the HERA actually looks pink! I suppose it depends on the lighting and context- the link above will be able to show a more ""true"" color under studio lighting. I went and tested the foundation again on my face to make sure everything blended in well. When I first put on the foundation, it looked much too light but darkened to the correct shade as it dried. If it's overdone, it will stay wet and too light. I haven't had any trouble blending it in. I'd recommend using a brush, and then a wet sponge combo (though not entirely necessary) to guarantee a flawless finish (just don't use your fingers- that doesn't work on this foundation).",4

중립,"Hi there, it didn’t oxidise on me. I was hoping that it would since 23w is a tad light for me. I can get away with it in light layers and a bronzer. We’re in autumn right now so that might perform differently during summer. I can’t remember it oxidising on me though..",2
중립,"Thanks for the reply! I'm going to bookmark this for my future Hera purchase. Since it's quite costly, I hope that I pick the right shade. Oh yes Saerom Min's videos are so helpful, thanks for the link! May I ask what kind of foundation brush do you use for this foundation? I also use the brush-followed by sponge (I use a cushion compact sponge) technique, I find it helps to remove excess foundation & brush marks, and reduces transfer onto a mask.   

I'm also a fan of the Biore sunscreen! Since it's summer, I've been using a matte finish foundation but I'm on the hunt for something that doesn't cling to my dry patches after long hours of wear.",1
중립,"I'm glad to hear Hera Black foundation doesn't oxidise on you. I still haven't had an opportunity to try mine yet! I really enjoy Korean cushions, because they don't oxidise. (I think, only Clio oxidises on me.) None of my Missha or Hera cushions have oxidised.

I bought a few different shades in both lighter and darker colours of Cover FX Custom Cover Drops (not sure if these are discontinued). I add a tiny amount to my foundation when I apply to adjust the colour. It has saved me so much anxiety. I've been able to use many more of my products all year.",2
중립,"I just bought the Hera cushion and wanted to rave about it because it was also a day I was testing 2 other foundations (Fenty Hydrating & Rare Beauty) and this was the one that took the cake. I got so many remarks that my skin looked really flawless, smooth and glowy before they even realised I was wearing base (I usually don't use base at all). 

It dries matte and I personally didn't notice any oxidation for the cushion (I use 25N1) but I did have to powder it quite a bit to reduce the tackiness cause I have combination-oily skin. It lasts forever though and I didn't have to touch up at all even after wearing it for 7 hours. 

A little really goes a long way because I'd barely tapped the cushion into the product and it managed to cover all my redness and smoothen the texture out that I had to layer multiple times for with Fenty and Rare, while looking really natural. I would say medium coverage but buildable to a full.

It's definitely pricey, but I got this off Shopee SG so it was marked down compared to buying it from the physical retail or off Sephora. 

Hope this helps!",3
중립,"I just use a flat foundation brush to spread it all over my face before patting it in! Because it's very pigmented/full coverage, I've found that it's important to distribute it as evenly (and work quickly) as you can before blending it in or you may get uneven coverage. I've also read that it works really well with the one that was bundled with it at the beginning, it's called ""Foundation Brush 02 matte"" on their website- so I assume a similar brush would work as well!

I hope everything goes well with choosing the right shade- it's so hard to pinpoint exactly online. It's definitely the most expensive foundation I own! When my skin is really having a flakey off day, I use the non-AB milk primer on top of my sunscreen as well.",1
중립,"Hi! Did you end up purchasing the foundation? If so, which shade did you go for?",1
부정,"I used to have a sheer bronzing tint that I use to darken my lighter shades. Might need to grab a new one, like the Australis match maker shade adjusting drops. But sometimes I just use my other darker foundations as a mixer or I just can’t be bothered and somehow make it work with bronzer and blush. Once all the other products are blended on top, it’s not bad. 
Yeah same for me, I didn’t seem to notice cushion foundations or my bb creams to oxidise. The hera foundation is similar to that of bb cream and their cushion. Unlike the western foundations, they can oxidise pretty bad (eg Mac, Nars)",2
긍정,"Oh thanks for your review on the Hera cushion! Did you only set it with powder and nothing else? It seems pretty amazing to last for 7 hours...were you wearing it under a mask? Also I was wondering if you normally wear shade 25 in Korean cushion foundations?   I'm in Canada, I wish we had Shopee here but unfortunately we don't so there's only a few online retailers that sell Hera and Sephora Canada does not carry that brand.",2
중립,"Hi there! I didn't end up getting the Hera liquid foundation because I got the Hera cushion (the older formulation with HERA on the case, not the 2021 version) and the shade 23N fits me quite well!",1
긍정,"I used primer as well, but that's usually my habit. I wore it under a mask, but not all 7 hours. Probably just for 2? And yes, I  live in sunny Singapore and I'm pretty tanned so I was really happy to finally get a darker Korean cushion shade. Any other cushion never had the right shade for me. I think online retailers should also sell them in shade 25, and it even goes up to shade 27 now (newly released). You could try [BeautyBoxKorea](https://beautyboxkorea.com/product/hera-black-cushion-spf34-pa-15g2ea-2021-new/46028/?cate_no=24&display_group=1)? They have worldwide shipping and the 2021 release of the cushion!",3
긍정,">for example, here is the official swatch of the bbia velvet tint shade range 34-38, a range very famous for unique (for AB) mlbbs; here is a laughably variable range of influencer swatches; the bottom right swatch has swatches in the same photo that don't even look the same. which one do you believe? my theory is influencers will edit/light their photos in whatever they personally find the best, or in multiple ways so that they can sell the same product to multiple audiences by changing its selling point; for example, people that like cool deep browns will buy 38, but so will people that like medium muted oranges.  


Honestly I trust influencer swatches more than brand swatches. The BBIA official swatches look absolutely ridiculous to me, and a lot of the time, for 3CE, influencer swatches look closer to what I have IRL than what is on the website. I don't see why an influencer is more likely to edit swatches more than the brand sponsoring them. This is a very debatable point, but I think a brand is more likely to edit their official swatches more than an influencer because the brand is the one trying to sell units of the product. The influencer is just making quick cash off of swatch photos, and has less stake in whether or not the product actually gets sold. They just want to look good, so they'll throw in a few liquify tools here and there, blur the skin, etc, but not actually mess with the color of the product (unless its something like foundation or concealer).

I've never been able to order certain makeup products online and have them then up even remotely similar to the swatches (especially all the pretty lip tints I fall in love with the online swatches)...

I've always had very cool toned skin, but never really understood the concept of 'muted', or that multiple tones could be present, so thank you for explaining why many products may look like overkill (super bright, super pink or super orange) on me. Unfortunately, every colour analysis I've had showed all the 'classic' details of being cool toned, except for the veins on my wrist (blue/purple...and blue green) so there was some suggestion I might be neutral, except that neutral tones don't work well on me lol...and I never even considered the effects of lighting

긍정,"ive always found the standards they set to be unrealistic and ridiculously high - and it often goes unchecked because we're not that used to spotting the tricks asian swatches employ. they look beautiful and inspiring, but sometimes it's just discouraging and unfair, especially to newbies. just as a disclaimer, the first earl gray swatch may be a little darker irl because of lighting and camera quality (like all others, even my swatches can't be fully trusted heh), but i do remember scrubbing my lips with that balm trying to get that payoff.

OK honestly I'm just here to rave about my first ever holy grail lip product that I repurchased: Amuse Nu Dew Tint #09 Seoul Soul. Plus I don't see much swatches of Hera products as well which I thought would be popular since Jennie is the face of it :0 Anyways here's my two cents on my collection...

(from top to bottom swatch)

**1. Amuse Nu Dew Tint #09 Seoul Soul** \- Honestly I really love this formula and no hate on romand but I prefer so much more than their Romand Glasting Water Tint. Similar to romand, it forms a gloss after application, however it is much less pigmented and gives me the most natural glow from within kinda texture. This shade gives me the most naturally pigmented lips as though I was born with it plus it doesn't draw too much attention. The colour in the photo probably doesn't do it much justice, it is slightly more brighter and a tinge of orangey red. Not sure if I'm correct, but I think this shade is a little similar to the latest Romand Juicy Lasting Tint launch, #22 and #23 (or at least it has similar vibes) and I really have been eyeing it for a while though I'm afraid to get it. Plus what I love about the packaging is that it dispenses a little product at a time which makes the opening less goopy since I don't have the scrape off the product. The packaging is also sleek and transparent which makes it so much easier to see how much is left

&#x200B;

**2. Romand Glasting Water Tint #Rose Splash** \- I originally considered this decluttered but after taking this out to try again for this post,  I think I can still make it work XD. I still stick to what I said about it being very pigmented. So in order to make it work, I'll have to scrape of basically the whole product off of it in order to have a less bold look. The colour is said to suit both warm and cool tones and if I'm not wrong, was one of the top 3 best selling lip by Romand in 2020. The colour leans neither too pink or too red. What I dislike about this is that the packaging dispense so much product as a time which is so annoying that I always have to scrap it off which makes the opening goopy and in turns gets onto the stick of the wand. And having the Amuse tint made me realise how much I appreciate transparent lip packaging where I can see how much is left and is easier for me to scrape out all the product. Maybe I'm being fussy but that's what I gotta do if I don't want my collection to grow too big. While I am considering other romand lip products like the Glasting Tint #22 and #23, the packaging is a hurdle for me, but I'm still super tempted 😭
&#x200B;

**3. Hera Sensual Spicy Nude Balm #Moody**  \- this was a recent purchase for myself after so much contemplation. This colour gives a natural coral pink to the lips and as someone who's not a big fan of pinks I find it to work well on me, unless I put on a very thick layer which is sliiightly pushing it. The formula is a little transparent, as what you'd expect of a balm and goes down wayyy too fast. Since it's of a balm formula, I reapply it often and it's about 2.5/11 done in a month 💀 with 60 applications. Also, this formula gives a tingly sensation when applied to have a plumping effect which err is a claim I would like to refute 😂 The packaging is also really pretty and luxe and I'm considering getting 3 more to do a DIY brush holder with the cap 😅. So I most likely will be repurchading this range and there's high chance I'll rebuy this shade after trying others

&#x200B;

**4. Hera Fresh Nude Tint #233 Pure Tattoo** \- I don't understand why this is labelled a tint when it doesn't stain the lips. I could easily wipe it off with a tissue without any makeup remover so to me this is more of a velvet formula. This formula is also very easy to blend to feel like nothing on the lips. I'm so glad I managed to get buy them from someone who got this as a gwp for $2 for 1.4ml which is a total steal XD. This shade is a coral red and seems to suit both warm and cool tones. To add on, I notice that with a thicker layer, the colour seems to have some sort of neon/very bright tone? While I do find it pretty with a light layer and enjoy it, it isn't a sort of colour I would repurchase. Will probably try out the other colours though idk when (eyeing #Bare Root)

&#x200B;

**5. Hera Fresh Nude Tint #465 90s** \- (formula described above if you skipped) This is a brownish red and is a rather deep colour. I'm not one for the deep colours but I bought it to try since it looked much lighter on Jennie where I saw somewhere that the makeup artist used a concealer on the lips before applying it (if I'm not wrong, it's one of the black cushion ad where she wore it). Well I tried concealer/foundation on the lips and it's ain't it 🤡 but by using a thin layer I think it still looks good and not too red. With a thin layer, I find that it looks more brown compared to if I were to apply a thicker layer where it becomes this deep red. While I do enjoy this its unlikely I will repurchase it since I used such a thin layer each time and probably won't use it enough to make the whole bottle worth it. I might get it in the sample form if I do manage to find it.

Not sure if this review is too long, but from my notes app it does seem so 😬. Hopefully we can see more brands of lip swatches and because I am gonna buy that Amsue tint till I die, I need yall to love them too so it will never be discontinued 😭

Edit: typo",21
긍정,"I love ab lip products and there are not enough reviews out there, thanks for posting!",8
긍정,"Absolutely in LOVE with the **Amuse Nu Dew Tint** too!! 💖 I have it in *#11 Boksoonga* and it's honestly my favorite AB glossy tint formula, definitely triumphed Romand's glossy tints imo. I find Romand's gloss too fragranced and has a chemical taste that lingers on the lips, I can't stand it. Amuse gloss has a relatively light pomegranate scent, but doesn't linger after application which I much appreciate. The stain on the lips also stayed true to color and doesn't turn deeper or more vibrant over time.

Would you say the **Hera Fresh Nude Tint** formula has a mediocre gloss formula compared to **Amuse Nu Dew**? 😂😂With no stain formula, it really sounds more like western lip gloss formula.",7

중립,"GURL yes!! Amuse tint is supreme 😍😂😂 I finished #11 Boksoongna but unfortunately it was too light to give life to my lips 😭

The **Hera Fresh Nude Tint** is the completely different formula compared to **Amuse Nu Dew**. Its a velvet matte formula that isn't drying at all. There's barely any glow to it since it's not those shiny gloss but I guess from the photo you can see that there's still some reflection since it's not super matte. so yeah in terms of gloss it's super mediocre 😂😂",5
중립,Amuse can be quite affordable when you wait for their flash sales 😍 If you're able to buy them from shopee wait for their flash sales and shop vouchers. I waited for the flash sales and on top of it the shop had a 30% off voucher so I got it less than S$10 🤑 Not to mention the gifts they gave?!? I literally got a full sized lip tint as a freebie 😱,1

중립,[deleted],1
긍정,"Yeah I wish k-beauty brands have more lip samples though I get that it'll definitely hurt sales. I like the Hera Tint but I don't love the colour but since bare root looks similar to Amuse Seoul Soul, I have my eye on it 👀

I saw the Amuse new dew velvet, I follow them on Instagram so I keep up with all their releases 😭😅 The texture looks cool and something I've never tried before. I'm still little hesitant since usually such formulation stains very well and I'm scared that it gets super vibrant after reapplication. But considering a light stain in Nu Dew I really might take a leap of faith. Also the packaging not being the same size as Nu Dew is giving me ocd 😂 

 I'd probably contemplate about it again when I repurchase the nu dew but for now the temptation has been contained 😬",5
긍정,"Aww thanks, love!",1
긍정,"yeah, lip samples are probably more feasible for luxury brands. I think Hera also has samples/travel sizes for their products though, have defo seen the mini cushions around! Bare root looks like a gorg color, seems like a pumpkin-y orange brown which is quite rare in sea of corals, pink and reds of typical kbeauty tint shades. 

The light staining quality of Amuse definitely took me by surprise and why I love it too! Dew velvet when compared to 3CE blur water tint which has similar texture quality, I saw some reviews online showing the crazy strong tint in 3CE - more reminiscent of old school water tints I'm guessing.

umm what, this is news to me?? 😨😳 i thought it's same packaging but frosted matte???? link me the pic to put me off from the temptations of buying it plz 😂😂",4
중립,Hahahaha you can see the comparison in this YouTube video around the 50 seconds in https://youtu.be/IhIXTgDNufk 😂😂,3
중립,"honestly it’s such a weird design choice, why is the cap shorter when the bottom is exactly the same 😵‍💫🤨

Ggemo’s swatches are always helpful, I think I saw her dew velvet swatch video but haven’t seen the comparison video, thanks for the link! Ggemo is always on top of it with new releases, just wished she would add eng subs 🥲 lol",3

중립,Rom&nd in burny nude looks similar!,15
중립,That looks really similar to Romand zero velvet tint in Burnt Heart. Kind of a muted rose that doesn’t look too warm or too cool toned. I haven’t tried it personally but it’s been on my wishlist for a while :),13
중립,"It looks similar to my HG color, Clio Mad Matte Lipstick in Sensual Pepper.",6

중립,I have both Rosy Suede and Rom& Burnt Heart! Would you like a swatch?,3

중립,"https://imgur.com/a/8XlRcFg  here ya go! 

I find rosy suede’s grey tones to really show up on the lips, while burnt heart is definitely a more cool toned higher chroma rosy. I prefer hera’s formula bc it clings a little less on my lips and it blurs the lip lines beautifully but both are stunning and definitely get a lot of use from me!",13
긍정,Thank you for the swatches!! Greatly appreciate your notes on the tones.. They do look super similar. It looks like Burnt Heart is a no-go for me though since it leans on the cool-toned side; I'm warm so I'm hesitant to try it.  I wonder if I'll have to splurge on Rosy Suede though after hearing about how it blurs because that look is definitely what attracted me to the product...,1
중립,"Haha, I feel you. I debated buying them for AGES. But as a grad gift for myself I bought Pampas and then IMMEDIATELY went to buy Rosy Suede and Deja Vu. The formula is soooo beautiful and weightless. I bought them because all the ig swatches has a sort of moodiness to them and I just absolutely adore the allure it brings to the face. 

I found Minsco’s swatches to be super helpful! https://youtu.be/FeqGarOAmNU",7

I’m curious tho is glowpick like an official beauty award in Korea or?",16

중립,"Oops, I use the Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream for my face :p",22
중립,"The mochi toner is more watery compared to the dr jart. To me, the mochi feels like a milky consistency and has a light scent. The dr jart has a citrus scent and feels more like a light lotion. Fyi I could also smell the alcohol afterwards after applying.

My skin had no noticeable effect using either, so I sadly cannot provide an insightful comparison. 😓 If anything you can try a 200ml mochi toner for fairly cheap.",12

중립,"Thanks for this info! It’s always interesting to see dupes of k-beauty items, considering my skin agrees with typical AB formulations way more but I struggle to find them/afford them sometimes.

Random note, even though it’s based in Seoul, the Hera packaging totally makes me think older lady skincare, like Estée Lauder. 🤷🏼‍♀️",24
중립,The Pink Moisturizer by Pure Beaty is probably similar (based on the ingredients). I haven’t tried any of these though.,10
중립,Me wondering how I'm going to get either of those in my country.,1
중립,"I think it's supposed to! AmorePacific makes each of their brands catered to a certain age range, and Hera is for more mature skin, irrc like late 30s-40s.",2
긍정,"Roseroseshop, cosmetic love, jolse, and ibuybeauti all have the hera. Do any of those deliver to your country?",3
중립,"Ah, I more mean that it doesn’t look like _Korean_ beauty packaging. I honestly thought it was one of those ‘inspired by k-beauty’ brands at first.",2
중립,"Yeah, if you're new to K-beauty I could see that- all the western hype seems to be around the cute + functional packaging in Korean beauty. But as you go for products that are marketed/made for older folx, you'll find the branding tends to be similar to old-lady brands like Estee Lauder and Lancome. Especially the jars!",4
중립,"I’m not new to k-beauty. I’m used to seeing the expensive, older-market k-beauty packaging looking more traditionally Korean, like the Missha Geum Sul line, Sulwhasoo, Beauty of Joseon, and even Amore Pacific’s Youth Revolution line.

The Hera stuff doesn’t look anything like that to me. It looks distinctly western.

ETA: I don’t mean this in a negative way. I’m just saying that it looks more like western skincare packaging than what I usually think of when I think of fancy, mature market Korean skincare. If you look up Estée Lauder skincare it looks exactly like a lot of the other Hera products, and if you look up the other brands I mention, they look nothing like the Hera products. I don’t personally use any of those products anyway, it’s just an observation.",1
중립,"Cushions tend to pill on me too. Another user suggested that I take more time between toner/essence/moisturizing and all the prep before putting on the cushion foundation. Also, I found that the Hera one was really thick which contributed to dryness as well.",2
중립,"I have the same issue here, also Combination skin. Tried the OG Cushion from Laneige but it dries out once I applied it. I tried a couple more cushions with different skincare prep beforehand but they all failed on me.
When I opted for the moisturizing ones that give you the ""chok chok skin"", they only make my face looks shining with oil. Right now, I'm just going foundation-free.",1
긍정,"There are english subs, so make sure to turn those on if you don't understand Korean like me lol.

Some key points:

\- Make sure to match your face if your neck is a lot darker, and either blend down, or use 'two-tone' foundation to blend it.

\- Swatch along your cheek, not your hand.

\- Don't compare foundations that are wet, because they often oxidize. Also, blend them out to find which one is a good match, because no one wears foundation that thick.

\- A common problem is that foundations have too high chroma, aka saturation. This is why you may look orange or red.

If you look at the youtube channel Yootrue on Air, she has a full lip swatch review of every color of this tint. She doesn't have english subs, but she does write out the number and name in korean so if you look at 03 Flower Market you can see how the color truly looks like. Which is a cool toned reddish pink imo. The longevity is also quite nice, although not quite as 9 hrs long lasting as the Wakemake or Too Cool for school tints. It did last me through a run through.",4
