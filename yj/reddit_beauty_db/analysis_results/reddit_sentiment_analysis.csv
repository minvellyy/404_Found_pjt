중립,"You can plug the batch codes (usually printed on the back or bottom of the packaging) into a website online that can verify the authenticity, as well as provide information about the production and expiration dates.",2
중립,"It helps a lot if you have a known legitimate one on hand that you can compare to. otherwise it's difficult, because Korean companies are constantly tweaking their packaging and the wording on them.

Another tell is if the parts of the container don't fit together well. Not sure that applies much with this type of packaging.

The only way to really be sure you're getting a legitimate product is to only buy from reputable/verified sellers, unfortunately.",2

중립,Yeah i was just wondering if its safe to do it at home. I have obsession with straight hair but at salons its too expensive,1
중립,"No, I was simply responding to a rude comment from a complete stranger who has zero context about how or where I got this product. If they think asking a simple question is “ridiculous,” then they should be prepared to handle whatever response they get.",1
긍정,Thank you!,1
중립,You can! Just make sure to watch a ton of videos and do lots of research. One wrong step can damage your hair,1
중립,"And I was perfectly prepared to handle it. The question was truly ridiculous. And if I lack contextual information, it’s because you didn’t provide it.",0

중립,"Mixsoon has a beta glucan serum too


I'm surprised iunik is breaking you out. There are only 6 ingredients: 1 in water and the other 5 are very common in skincare. You should cross reference the ingredients list with your other products. If you find that you're very acne-prone, you might have a sensitivity to one of these common ingredients ",1
중립,i think it's the acrylates :(,1
중립,"Also live in Hawaii, used both. last time I ordered on stylevana, maybe 2 years ago it took around 2 months to arrive. It takes long bc each item has a est time of how long before it will actually ship to their warehouse. some is asap but some can take up to a month + the time it takes to actually get shipped to you. Just one of those items can hold back the entire order so I would try to only buy items with fast shipping estimates.i think yesstyle a lil faster but I haven't bought frequently enough to tell. on yes style it says theyll cover the tariif price and will refund u in credits if u get charged. Dk about styvana tarrifs though ",1
중립,"I noticed that number 3 gives my skin a subtle glow, while number 5 helped lighten my tan and some pigmentation around my neck. I prefer using number 5 regularly, and I turn to number 3 whenever my skin feels dull.",3
중립,"I got the number 3, it has so many fermented ingredients that it gave me acne,used it for 2-3 times only",2
중립,"I love numbuzin but I really hate toner 3 because of its smell.
It reminded me of a very old toilet refreshner scent, I just couldnt.",1
부정,"I used to hate the toner vitamin toner but I'll tell you what it does, it makes your face looks glowly. I haven't seen any improvement in my pigmentation but it does make it look glowy.",1
중립,"I use the 5 in the morning, for an antioxidant boost, because I don't use a Vitamin C serum at the moment. And I use the 3 at night, its more hydrating without being greasy. One little  splash is enough, if I use more I feel sticky (with both of them)",1
긍정,"Honestly, sounds like you need something like the HaruHaru Barrier Essence to strengthen and repair your skin barrier. If Numbuzin No. 1 toner isn't working, meant for soothing, the others might not work either. 

I love the Numbuzin No. 1 Suncreen. Just recently started using it. It helps in calming skin for me, but when the barrier is irritated due to the actives I'm using, it's the HaruHaru Barrier Essence to which I turn.",1

btw you dont need eye cream,mostly it's overpriced small moisturiser",1

중립,"Alltimate PHA Toner (AM only)

Isntree Green Tea Emulsion 

Numbuzin No. 1 Suncreen or Isntree Hyaluronic Sun Gel or BoJ Relief Aqua or HaruHaru Airyfit (I can personally vouch and highly recommend Numbuzin No. 1 rn. I do have BoJ RA and HH AF in storage, but haven't tried them yet)

HaruHaru Wonder Barrier Essence 

Alltimate Vegan Mucin Peptide Cream (Night moisturizer if needed)

These all cost under Rs. 1000 in sales, and will help you control sebum too over time. Personally using these while living in Mumbai. Sebum controlled quite a lot. 

You don't need a separate eye cream. I use BoJ Revive eye serum, but that's because I wanted a gentle retinoid for eyes, and I'm way old than you and have neglected skin care for decades. So, needed that. You don't. Just use the other products, except the toner as you don't need to use exfoliating acids around the eyes. 

I also double cleanse and use adapalene and azelaic acid, but you don't really need those. Just start with the above mentioned and see how it works over the next few months.",1
중립,"Try getting trial kits. Your favourite brand might do them you tend to get a face wash , moisturiser and something else usually spf. This way you have all the basic things you need for a lower cost than if you were to buy them individually. This doesn’t always work as sometimes the products are so small so always check the ml",1
부정,"Toner are just waste of money and is literally water most of the times but if you still wanted to get one, I'd suggest you to target your skincare, i use the rounlab toner, it's hydrating and does gentle exfoliation. For moisturizer you can try the reequil one, i have the same skin type as you but I'm acne prone  too, safe to say it didn't break me out and was moisturizing enough. It's a gel based formula and is very light weight. I emptied out 3 bottles of it.",0
중립,Erborian cc cream red correct. I had to go to multiple Olive Youngs to get it since it's sold out everywhere,1
긍정,"I really like purito centella bb cream. I have sensitive skin, quite dry, redness and acne from time to time and eczema prone.
It s a natural covering, very cheap and with a good lasting power",1
중립,S.nature Aqua Squalene moisture cream!,6
중립,Dr g blemish soothing cream,3
긍정,"Have you tried the Aestura AtoBarrier365 cream? It's filled with high-density ceramides that will help ward off the dryness. This product paired with the Sungboon Editor Green Tomato lifting ampoule should help with your dryness and pore concerns! You also mentioned that you use Retinol, though. How often and how much Retinol do you apply? This may be a reason why your skin is not absorbing the ingredients of the moisturizers. Also! (Pro Tip) It's best to apply moisturizing products onto damp skin. They're much better absorbed that way.",2
긍정,"Hi! For starters, I have combination skin, thin, prone to dehydration and sensitive. Also, I HATE the feeling of creams on my face, so I always look for light finishes.

I love the Purito Deep Sea Pure Water cream, but the've changed the packaging and, I guess, the formula too. I don't know about the new one. The old one feels light, soft, almost fake, like it's not gonna hydrate. But it does. You just need a bit, like a pea or two for the whole face and it gets absorbed like a charm. And the hydration lasts. It has niacinamide and panthenol and its soothing, so it calms my skins redness. 10/10. Gonna pray they haven't changed the formula.  
The Centella Unscented Recovery cream is also a favourite of mine, mostly during winter, when the Deep Sea one is not enough (in summer the Centella one is too heavy as I live in a VERY humid place). It's a must for sensitive skins or damaged skin barriers. During summer, if my skin gets burned, I use this and the burn heals super fast. Love it. But they've changed the packaging too T\_T  
The Dermide Relief cream is a bit too thick for my liking as a daily moisturizer, but a great help when a specific spot on my face is specially dry or sensitive or when I wanna make a cream/serum more heavy (for ex, if the climate changes for a few days and it gets very dry).   
I also used Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream and I liked it very much. You can modulate how heavy or light it feels because you can apply more than one layer and it still gets absorbed (unlike Purito's Centella or Dermide Relief, or other creams I've tried, that you put more on your face and just.....sit there, pilling on top of each other). Purito's Deep Sea (old version) is like this too. It's gonna be my salvation if the Deep Sea has changed :\_)  
I also have Purito's Oat In Calming cream but, AGAIN, they've changed the formula. But I've heard great things about the gel version. I've heard it has the best of the cream and it's lighter, so........... Imma buy it soon xD

The Deep Sea would be my top recommendation. With it's formula, it helps with hyperpigmentation and uneven skintone, inflamation and hydration. It should still be a great hydrating cream. If not, the Klairs is great, but only for hydration.",1

중립,THIS!! So underrated!,2
중립,I am using this one currently but not sure if I am really into it. this looks lightweight while applying but it makes skin very oily and sticky even the smaller amount. So definitely not a daytime,0

긍정,Different strokes and all that! I find it a great day cream.,1
긍정,I am living in ireland and comparing to regular drugstore brands korean skincare is fab value . Like loreal nivea can cost more here than much better quality korean skincare. I am sorry you was not happy with suncream i bought cosrx aloe suncream and loved it ( used like 2 bottles ) its quite thick and great for dry skin so maybe was just not suitable for your skin type ?,18
중립,"Your country’s currency is low, that’s why. It’s cheap in Korea. 

And tariffs.. 

And inflation",49
중립,They are relatively cheaper here in Europe than local products. It could be about tariffs in your country.,6
긍정,"Stylevana has good prices, they often have really great discounts so maybe try there? The products are expensive for me too, so I pick the category I am willing to put a bit more financially into (even Stylevana prices are not small for my understanding) like sunscreen and buy from Stylevana since it is half the price compared to the same product that I would buy at a store that sells Korean beauty. (With the current codes I can get glow serum 60ml for about 10€ while it would be about 35-40€ in the store).


When it comes to having reactions that has nothing to do with price. You can react badly to any product, it all depends on your skin, allergies and other individual things.",4
중립,"I get what you mean about it being a gamble, not having access to testers, but it encourages us to be more attuned to what ingredients work for our skin. I have a spreadsheet where I list products and ingredients that haven’t gone well for me. I also find buying online is better price wise than local retailers but that depends on your local taxes / customs policy. You’ll often get samples in your parcel so can be an opportunity to test new products too.",3
중립,"KBeauty is pretty expensive in Canada compared to drugstore brands. As many have mentioned unfortunately it is varaible for so many reasons!

Whenever someone goes to Korea we all ask them to go shopping for us there 🫣 paying for checked bags costs less haha.

Take a look at the ingredient list on the sunscreen that didn't work, at least. Then you can start to learn which ingredients you want to avoid, and save a little money on buying products that won't break you out.",3
중립,Meanwhile me looking at Korean products and wondering how they make them so cheap. Even my DIY isn't much cheaper.,3
중립,[removed],8
중립,"They’re expensive due to shipping costs and the difference in wages between countries (Koreans earn a ton afaik). You can get products cheaper on places like YesStyle (I use this) and Stylevana. Ive also found that ordering online from pharmacies is sometimes the same price if not cheaper than the sites I listed, but I’m not sure if this is the case in India.",2
긍정,Try buying it from the kind life or Tira - they run great discounts .,1
중립,"Speaking in USD, when you look at the quality of ingredients and compare what the cost would be for something of that quality in the States, it's actually so cheap.",1
중립,I am Anerican. It sounds like  you are getting the cheapest products. I pay three times that amount orr the same product and that is considered cheap here.,-8
중립,Can be! It had this burning sensation on my face,1
중립,[removed],-40
중립,Price does not equal quality.  I swapped to Korean skincare which is 4 times cheaper than the premium brand I was using and my skin looks and feels much better.,7

긍정,I have both but prefer the booster pro because it has more modes on it. I would say the mini is good for younger aged skin . I am 45 and have noticed the booster pro has brightened and helped improved my skin so much. And the glow is amazing 😻,2
중립,"Does it have the electric impulses? My mini did, but they stopped. I def noticed a glow to my skin in just a few days and I’m 50. I’m thinking about getting the Age-R Ultra Tune. Have you heard if it’s better than the booster pro? Or is it basically the same?",1
긍정,I haven’t really looked into that one cause the booster pro has helped my skin so much. Yes the electrical impulses I feel are stronger with the booster pro I have had mine for over 3 months and still works amazing,2
중립,"Hi there! Just to ask - what shade are you? It'll affect the types of palettes you could use.

But, based on brands I would recommend the CLIO Pro Eye Palette Air, WAKEMAKE Soft Blurring Eye Palette  (if you're into sheer shadows), About Tone Return To Basic Eyeshadow Palette, LUMMIR Light On Eyeshadow Palettes or peripera All Take Mood Palette are some of my favorites :)",1
중립,"Absolutely agreed with all of these, they are all so versatile!",1
중립,"The ksecret one has a higher concentration (equivalent 0.2% retinOL). And it's a retinAL, meaning it's one step closer to converting to retinoic acid S opposed to retinOL which requires two steps ",3
중립,"The ksecret one dod nothing for me. Too low concentration
I can actually feel the celimax working, it might be the spicules helping it",3
긍정,"Havent tried the Séoul 1988 but love the celimax.
My skin is always super smooth the next day, pore tighter and if any acne spot it helps to heal faster",2
긍정,Thanks for your review - I’ve been tempted to try ksecret after having been using celimax retinol (and a tester of their retinal) - good to know. I also feel like the celimax retinol is working every time,2
중립,15ml😅,0
긍정,And there s always good prices on yesstyle for it,2
중립,"The one you put on the post is 30ml
The retinAL  one is 15ml and way stronger",3
중립,"Kind of depends on the finish of the product and your skin type. Also how long you want it to hold up for. How does it feel on your skin? Does it transfer once it’s dried down? With some products I can get away with just a setting spray to help it settle. With others I need a light powder if I need it to wear longer, especially if it’s more likely to transfer or settle into creases.",1
중립,"It’s a matte finish, and no it doesn’t really transfer when dried down, it’s basically waterproof. Espoir said that it doesn’t need to be set because of the finish idk how it will last if I dont use powder",1
중립,It should be fine. But you’re just going to have to do an all day wear test to see if you will need to add anything,1
중립,Isntree hyaluronic acid watery sungel,2
중립,Have you tried TOCOBO Cica Calming Serum? It’s really lightweight and sets super fast. I enjoyed using/wearing it but the finish was a bit too shiny for my taste… I’m oily and afraid of glow though lol. It didn’t pill on me. I can’t speak to how it works under makeup.,1
중립,Round Labs Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen. But I don’t understand how your sunscreen can pill hours after you apply it. You should not be touching your face so I don’t understand how it can happen.,0
긍정,Thank you!,1
중립,I don’t think I said I touched it. I felt something on my face and looked in the mirror and physically saw the pilling residue. I’m not sure what else I can tell you.,1
긍정,The iunik centella cream is amazing!! Fully recommended,8

It s cheap and worked wonder when my skin was damaged",1
중립,Anything in particular about anua? What do you feel when putting it on your face?,1
중립,Did you experience purging w the Anua?,1
중립,I also have really loved the gel cream!,2
중립,What do you think of the tea tree relief serum? I have the Propolis vitamin synergy serum from iunik and I really like it but I find it kind of heavy for layering,1
긍정,"I think the formula is very nice and light, I've been wearing it almost every day under sunscreen for the past 2 weeks. It's definitely helping with my reddness from rosacea and I think it's somewhat helping my closed comedones though I'm not sure that could also be the retinoid i started using. It's hydrating and soothing and the azelaic acid isn't too concentrated so I can wear it without a problem even when my skin is irritated . 

If you want more of the azelaic acid benefits I'd go with the 15% version, I just felt like it would be too irritating for my skin at the moment",1
중립,Not OP but I did not and I have extremely sensitive skin,2
중립,"not op but i have very oily, acne prone skin and didn't experience purging with it. it helped my skin like no other !",2
긍정,"I'm probably not the best person to answer this right now, because I recently started a stronger retinoid so I am experiencing purging from that.. I haven't noticed any difference in the amount of purging since starting to use the Anua serum though :)",1
긍정,Thank you!,1
중립,I use the ordinary copper peptides under my eyes and it seems to be helping a lot! Just keep in mind that it’s a more gradual result than something like retinol. My skin is too sensitive for retinol around my eyes.,1
중립,I’ve used beauty of joseon revive eye serum which has retinal! I liked it a lot but stopped using it when I started tret,1
긍정,"I recommend retinol. Even if it’s not specifically an eye cream, applying it all over your face really makes a noticeable difference. Most eye creams seem to contain a small amount of retinol, but I recommend the ones from iope and mary&may. For a retinol serum that you can use on your entire face, Innisfree is a great choice!",1
중립,Thanks for the rec! I’ll check it out 🤍,2
중립,"Second this, I’ve tried loads of eye creams but this one has actually made a difference for me!",3
긍정,"Thank you, I’ll have a look!",1
중립,"Just fyi, tret is too strong for your undereye area. You might want to go back to BOJ for your undereyes at least",1
중립,"Just so you know, I have extremely thin and sensitive skin and I use Beauty of Joseon Revive eye serum every night without problem. A LOT of other products give me strange reactions, my skin burns, my eyes itch like crazy....but this serum is completely fine. I was honestly astonished xD",1
중립,"Oh I don’t use the tret on my under eye area, I just stopped using other actives to be safe! I wasn’t really clear though.",2
중립,"I have come to really enjoy the beauty of joseon - I use the cleansing balm followed by the green plum cleanser, which has mung bean also. The combination keeps my skin quite clear. Noticeable difference when I use something different.

Also like that they're only 100 ml so I can take them when I fly.

Edited for typos - talk to text was not my friend today.",1
중립,"As much as I'd encourage people to only buy vegan products for ethical reasons, products containing a longer list of plant-derived ingredients are not inherently gentler... in this case both solutions are plant-based, but a. 20% lactic acid is generally gentler than 7% glycolic acid, and b. The Ordinary products, especially those with high concentrations of actives, are notorious for not being formulated with sensitive skin in mind, unlike the majority of k-beauty.

As a side note I recently started using that FULLY peeling serum and I'm very impressed with it so far, but I've only gotten to use it twice so it's too early to tell my full thoughts on it",7
긍정,"I’ve tried both, and I thought both were great!",2
중립,What is your usual routine for the glycolic acid toner?,1
중립,"Axis-y pha glow peel. I use it on my rosacea and  it's gentle enough that it works without irritating it. I was scared by the word peel but it's a put on, leave on for ten minutes and wash off type of product",1
중립,"I second your entire first paragraph.

I personally use The Saem Cell Renew Bio Micro Peel Soft Gel as a gentle physical exfoliate and any of those mild “clearing” pads that have tolerable ingredients for my skin.",3
긍정,Oh nice! Glad to hear both worked well for you — now I’m even more tempted to try them!,1
긍정,"I heard that toner pads aren’t really good for pores. It’s fine to use them occasionally, but not every day. It’d be better to apply vitamin C in the morning and add retinol in the night routine. You’re already doing perfectly!",3
중립,It’s $12.99 for the box set at TJMaxx/Marshalls,2
중립,"Did anyone try it? How does it smell? I'm really sensitive if it comes to smell, does it smell too chemical?",1
중립,"It doesn’t smell chemical, but it does have a pretty strong scent while showering. There’s a slight smell left afterward — once your hair dries, you can still smell it, but it’s not too strong or annoying. I tried it, and it made my hair very soft, in my opinion.",1
중립,CNP Laboratory Propolis Energy Active Ampule gives me glass skin,1
긍정,Erborian is a French/Korean brand and I love it,5

There's also a lot of new releases bb cream like etude and wakemake",4

긍정,Missha is a win! Erborian was nice but the tint made me look too orange!,3
긍정,"i love the BOJ tinted sunscreens! they come in several shades and look like skin. i’ve gotten a lot of compliments on my skin since using it, it’s light coverage but even me out",3
중립,"Big fan of the glow bb cream , expensive but worth itttt",2
긍정,I love the Purito one!,2
중립,Missha bb cream if you are on a budget! Tho it is quite on the gray side because koreans prefer a much fair complexion so it may not quite match if you are on the tanner side. But you can make it work by applying a light layer of it (it’s because it’s quite thick in my opinion!) I’m also trying the erborian bb cream but i just received it today so i don’t have any experience with it haha,2
중립,im on my 3rd bottle of “all about glow cover cream from chasin rabbits”,2
중립,I am a big fan of missha in the red tube.  I like to apply with a cushion puff.,2
긍정,"if you want something matte, Etude All Day bb cream.

my go to and popular amongst a lot of MUAs in Korea is the Cell Fusion Skin Blemish Balm Intensive, great for acne, breakouts, and pores - they will mix it with a foundation (atm the best combi is the About Tone semi matte foundation) if higher coverage is desired. all these aren't greyish toned and works really well.

personally not a fan of Erborian due to the shades, and it's a bit thick and the product needs to be worked into the skin.",2
중립,I like the glow one but it only comes in one shade and then you have to mix it. Not a skin tint but I’ve been enjoying the milk touch glow cushion,2
중립,It cosmetics cc cream = full coverage!!!,2
긍정,I love Ilia Skin Tint for this purpose! Or Tower 28 Sunny Days.,0
중립,Came to say Erborian CC.,2
긍정,I second erborian. I love the primer with it as well.,1
긍정,Thank you for your recommendation! How did you find the shade match as in like did it matched your skin tone perfectly?,1
중립,Which one would you recommend the most out of them? ,1
긍정,"this is a good list! phymongshe is good but slightly pricey and i second the erborian recs above. 
missha is a classic but used to have a slight grey tinge, although i heard that they since improved.
please note that newly released products from etude and wakemake are less like bb/ccs and more like light coverage foundation despite the marketing.",1
중립,Does it smudge easily? Heavy coverage is no problem for me! ,1
긍정,"I seen loads of good reviews on TikTok about missha! Glad to know it’s also a good option on here, thank you for your recommendation! ",1
긍정,I’ll definitely have a look into it!! Thank you for your recommendation! ,2
긍정,Is it very long lasting too? Thank you for your recommendation! ,1
긍정,It’s in my top 3 contender as of now! Thank you for the recommendation!! ,1
긍정,Let me know how the erborian cream is!! Missha sounds perfect! I prefer the fair complexion look thanks!!,1
긍정,"Ooo I’ve never heard of this brand, I’ll look into it thank you!",1
중립,Does it apply better with a cushion puff? ,1
긍정,Thank you for sharing!! I will look into the cell fusion one!,1
중립,Are you using the new reformulated version of the cell fusion bb cream? I recently saw that they came out with a newer one without niacinamide and added two new shades! I ordered the new one from Amazon and it seems pretty thick so hoping it wont clog pores.,1
긍정,"I will look into it, thank you!! ",1
긍정,Thank you!! Will look into it ,1
긍정, I will look into it but it’s a bit out of my price range but thank you for your recommendation! ,1
긍정,"Love erborian, and cant wait till I get the primer!",2
중립,"At most there are, I believe, 5 options. Depending on the retailer, there are usually only 3 options. I use Clair which is their lightest and it blends right in.",2
긍정,"I don’t think it smudges easily. Or at least no more than my other products. It always looks nice on my face no matter what I do. You can get a sample at Sephora to try, that’s what I did since I wasn’t sure which shade would look best.",2
부정,"Hi! So a few days ago I received my erborian bb cream and did a wear test from 11 am until 8 pm! I would say that the bb cream is not bad, i think i just got a bit hesitant because the shade is bit lighter than me (i got the nude one because it’s the darkest that i could find) upon application i think it’s a bit overwhelming for me because it’s kinda thicker than the missha one but it’s still manageable as long as u apply them thinly! But on the other side, i got a small acne on my left cheek after using it but tbh idk if it’s really caused by the erborian cream (i did not experienced this with missha when i first tried it) 

For the overall experience, i would say that it’s the same with the missha one! I think it has a sheer to buildable coverage, and in my case, i only applied a thin layer to even out my skin and because the shade is a bit lighter for me. It doesn’t feel heavy on the skin as well and did not peeled off (this might depend on your skin prep) 

If you have a fair complexion and you have a budget, you can opt for the erborian one, I only got the 5ml and it’s already pricey for its size lol. But if you want to save money and have a diverse shade options, you can get the missha one. ^^",2
중립,i know they also have a “tone up” cream which i use for overall redness/ tone correction,1
긍정,I prefer it over a brush or beauty blender.  Fingers also good but I don’t like getting it under my nails!,2
중립,"yes I'm using the new version. it is thick when you squeeze it out of the tube, but it blends like a skincare cream and mixes well with other foundations. I either use it alone or blend it with a serum-like foundation for a more skin like finish, or with a matte foundation for more coverage. usually bb cream 2:1 foundation ratio.",1
긍정,Thank you!! ,1
긍정,"I’ll pop into Sephora and try that, thank you! ",2

긍정,"i use mostly fungal acne safe products and my skin is pretty dry and sensitive because i'm using a benzoyl peroxide cream.

this is my routine rn, my skin hasn't felt dry since i started on this routine. i've checked the ingredients on folliculitis.


- [TirTir Milk Skin Toner](https://tirtir.global/collections/skincare/products/milk-skin-toner): it makes a huge difference in terms of moisture, the only time my skin looked crusty was when i ran out of it 

- [Hado Labo Lotion Super Hydrator](https://hadalabotokyo.shop/products/hada-labo-tokyo-super-hyaluronic-acid-super-hydrator-lotion-for-age-18-39-150-ml-bottle-pack-of-1): i use this every day AM and PM after the toner/any actives to lock in everything. it 100% helps my skin retain any moisture but it doesn't do much just on its own

- [Cosrx Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/snail-mucin/products/advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence): heard it breaks some people out, hasn't done it to me tho. nice for an extra kick of moisture. it's super gentle, it was one of the only products that didn't make my face feel like it was on fire when i first started using benzoyl peroxide

- [Beauty of Joseph Rice + Probiotics Suncream](https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/relief-sun-rice-probiotics?_gl=1*fdralv*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvJHIBhCgARIsAEQnWlCdnlMB0wxQmL_NGNdTKNZwzHPvxRXM59_-EAVczdkyZy9Ap-e8GeIaArrXEALw_wcB&gbraid=0AAAAAp9LuYQ4ifStx8wbrUcbxCuSBza65&variant=43264254476453): it has ONE ingredient that gets flagged by folliculitis scout, but it was hard finding a suncream that was completely FAS (and available in ireland). i did use this [Boots](https://BootsSPF+InvisibleFaceDailySuncareFaceFluidSPF5050mlhttps://www.boots.ie/boots-spfand-invisible-face-daily-suncare-face-fluid-spf50-50ml-10344819) brand one which is FAS, but it would pill so badly and felt so thick. [this](https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-products-malassezia-pityrosporum-folliculitis/) website has a massive list of FAS products, but i would double check everything on the folliculitis scout ingredient checker


i also tried these two moisturisers before settling on this routine:


- [La Roche Posay Toleraine Sensitive Fluide](https://www.laroche-posay.co.uk/en_GB/toleriane-sensitive-fluid-moisturiser/LRP_914.html): it only has 11 ingredients but one layer is barely moisturising, and the price for the amount of product makes it not worth layering

- [Uriage Bariederm-Cica Daily Gel](https://www.uriage.com/AA/en/products/bariederm-cica-daily-gel-cream) it was definitely more moisturising than the la roche posay cream, but it left a weird film on the face that i didn't like",1

- angel’s liquid bha exfoliating body wash is my holy grail. i’ve gone through so many bottles and i can definitely see a difference in my skin. for context, i have keratosis pilaris so my arms are uneven in color and i definitely have seen more evenness in my skin and decrease of bumps. if you don’t have kp, i think you’ll see even faster results.

- cocoon an giang palmyra palm sugar body polish. i promise you that this will be a different experience than any other body scrub because it not only exfoliates but makes your skin SO soft and dewy after. i’ve tried so many body scrubs and usually think they’re often too drying. only con is if you’re sensitive to smell you might think it’s too strong, but i personally love the smell and after you wash it off there is a very small skin scent trail. the smell to me is like sweet ginger no bitterness at all.

For body acne, I tried Medicube red acne body peeling shot. I didnt like it. The spray stopped working after the 2nd use. The smell was strong and harsh.

중립,Do try next time for sure!!,1
중립,"I have normal to dry skin that’s pretty sensitive. I’ve started with the 100 and really like it. I do it probably every three days. I feel the tingly sensation the night I apply it the most, but it kind of disappears quickly and isn’t bothersome. When I do my morning skincare, I feel the tingle again, but much less. So I think the spicules take a while to dissolve. But to be clear I only feel it when I do my routine. After that, I don’t feel it.",3
부정,"I have been using Isntree Plum Peptide Booster 2000s for a couple of months, it wasn't too bad at all. Felt the obvious prickly sensation on the first time, thereafter I don't feel them that much because I got used to it  I guess? Idk. Everyone on here seems to be saying how uncomfortable their 1st experiences on VT Reedle 100 with some saying it hurt so much that they didn't continue.

So in my book, VT Cosmetics is the frontrunner of this spicules thing and they are sort of the benchmark to compare all other comapnies' spicules products. Since my first experience was with Isntree, and it was pretty mild, I thought the VT 100 would be a step up for me -- at the point I was thinking maybe the Isntree is only comparable to VT 50 perhaps in terms of sensation.

I just tried my first VT 100 a couple of days ago and I thought THAT was even milder than the Isntree? I hardly felt anything at all. So that was a surprise for me. I also have the 300 sample so I'll try that maybe in several days' time see how it feels.

In terms of effects and benefits on my skin, I can't really tell. My most problematic issue is my melasma. I'm hoping by using spicules, it would help anti tyrosinase inhibitors work much better, but melasma is a tricky thing if it's hormonal as even if the epidermal and dermal layers are being treated, the problem will still persist if systemically the hormones are doing the devil's work non-stop lol",1

Does it sting when u use the pore pads? If no to all of these I don’t think you have a compromised skin barrier. How long have u had this routine? It seems like a pretty solid one, and I wouldn’t want to recommend u add anymore actives if you’ve only been using them for a month or 2.",1

중립,"I wouldn’t use this product. It has far too many allergenic and sensitizing oils in it. The formulation incorporates a lot of citrus oils to give your skin a glow, and the other oils are for fragrance. But all of them are sensitizing, and shouldn’t be used on your face. Bergamot oil in particular is pretty nasty—it can cause contact dermatitis very easily. 

Also, you didn’t show the whole ingredients, so the retinol is not even visible. But it must be very low on the list. Not worth it.

You can get a MUCH better retinol product than this. I think you should toss this one.

Edit: Here it is on incidecoder. You can see all the problematic ingredients flagged here: https://incidecoder.com/products/c-k-d-retino-collagen-small-molecule-300-cream",4
중립,"I don’t believe it has retinol in it, I don’t see it in the ingredients list?",3
긍정,"So looks like this has 0.01% retinAL (a stronger retinoid than retinOL) which is roughly equivalent to 0.1% retinOL. That's a good beginner concentration (0.1% - 0.3% retinOL is what's usually recommended)


With retinoids, you want to make sure you're wearing SPF daily, not just the day after. Start with a small amount once a week (PM only) and slowly increase the frequency as tolerated. With retinoids, frequency and consistency is key. You want to use the highest concentration your skin can handle daily rather than a super high strength one infrequently. Retinoids are best on dry skin after cleansing and before the rest of your routine. But if that's still too irritating for you, you can use it with/after your moisturizer to buffer it until you can tolerate it better


That all said, retinAL is a very unstable ingredient. So without a good formulation, the retinAL will lose strength and won't be effective. And looking at that ingredients list... I really wonder whether it's a stable formula",3
중립,My skin shriveled up looking at that list,3
긍정,"I'll try to use it treating it like a really strong retinoid, just because I already spent my money on it 😭 thank you. Ig it gives me another reaction, I suppose I'll gift it to someone with strong skin.

중립,Right?? It’s contact dermatitis in a bottle.,3
긍정,"People cannot give you instructions on how to use a product without seeing the entire list of ingredients. The usage depends solely on the ingredients. But the point is irrelevant since I looked it up myself. 

You’ve had one reaction from the product. I’m not sure why you would give it a chance to give you another reaction. It’s full of phototoxic and photosensitizing ingredients. But good luck.",2
중립,Oh thanks. I went to check if the product had the same composition as I saw in sites. This collection releases so many similar products it's a little difficult to me to make sure I got the right one,2
중립,"Botanical extracts and essential oils can be irritating, especially citrus oils (they're even photosensitizing to an extent). Some people have more sensitive skin than others and can't tolerate them at all. Some are fine with them. The presence of botanical extracts isn't a deal breaker imo. But the amount, variety, and types in this particular product is *exceedingly* unnecessary. So much so that it makes me instantly doubt that this product is formulated well and turns me off from the entire brand. It feels like they don't know what they're doing 


I don't have a specific recommendation because I haven't really tried any. My skin is very sensitive to actives. I just cracked open the Iope super bounce serum (0.015% retinOL, super low) and I already have to be careful with it damaging my moisture barrier haha... 


I suggest looking at products from well known brands and produced by a reputable manufacturer (Kolmar, Cosmax, etc). You want a product that comes in opaque, air-tight packaging (no dropper bottles). Also do you due diligence and make sure the products actually have the % of pure retinOL or retinAL that they claim. There are many that actually have a lower percentage but use the total concentration of derivatives on the label to draw in consumers. I've personally landed on Iope after a lot of research and for a multitude of reasons. But there are quite a few Korean retinoids on the market now",2
긍정,"I didn't have a reaction from this product. I had a reaction from another product (one that is not asian beauty, in my country the beauty products tend to be too harsh). I read that AB retinoids are less sensitizing and searched for one that I saw good reviews. But I was confused by the lack of instructions, since I know retinoids are something to use carefully.

I didn't want to bother you, I'm grateful for your help. I didn't know the full list of ingredients is so important, I was only thinking about the lack of instructions. I'm really new into AB and I never used retinoid until 3 months ago.

Sephora is carrying the Biodance Collagen Mask to Foam Cleanser though and they are getting ready to do their fall Beauty Insider sale at the end of the month. Yami is another retailer to check out but their selection is limited and you need to make sure that you select items that are “fulfilled by Yami” because they ship out of Yami’s US warehouse.

중립,"Do buy on Sephora instead, little bit pricier but legit.",1
중립,Don't buy something if you have to ask if it's genuine?,3
중립,I haven't bought JM Solution in awhile but I remember that even their new releases ( including the Disney/Pokemon themed masks ) don't come with the magnetic strip anymore when purchased in a box like this.,2
중립,How would we know?,4
중립,"I bought one from yami buy like last year but on the sticker with the QR code, it has a like a silver bar across it. The sticker also had only Korean on it, while yours has Chinese.
But I don’t see any other differences from the packaging compared to yours",1
중립,"I’m currently in stores right now, and I spotted a JMsolution face mask pack, similar to what you bought. Do you want me to dm you the pictures?",0
중립,I saw videos from 4 months ago still saying that’s the way to authenticate… i don’t know any more 😥,1
중립,"Anyways there is a qr code printed on the little white solid plastic sticker used to  seal the box. 

To verify a JMsolution product, scan the QR code on the packaging using a smartphone camera or a QR code reader app. This will take you to an authorized website where you can check if the product is genuine by looking for details like the product code and a ""genuine"" confirmation on the page. Alternatively, some products also come with a magnet card for a second verification method. 

Steps to verify a JMsolution product using the QR code

Locate the QR code: Find the QR code on the product's packaging.

Scan the code: Use your smartphone's camera or a QR code scanning app to scan it.

Go to the verification page: The scan will direct you to an official JMsolution verification website.

Confirm authenticity: On the website, check the displayed information to confirm the product is genuine. Look for a red ""genuine"" word, a product code, and a scanned count. 

Alternative verification method (magnet card)

Some JMsolution products include a magnet card.

To use this method, place the magnet card near the upper right corner of the mask's verification area on the packaging.

The verification area should display a green stripe effect, indicating the product is authentic. ",2
중립,Why don't you message JM Solution directly?,1
중립,"Still the same problem. They have had my package for 2 and a half months and Style Korean says to just wait. At this point I think a chargeback is needed, especially since UPS has said it's destroyed my package. They're refusing to help and I would stay away, use another company who guarantees delivery.",2
중립,Olive Young,2
중립,"StyleKorean used to be the fastest, but I don't know now with the tariffs and shipping issues.",2
중립,I ordered from MOIDA from TN and it took less than a week to be delivered,1
중립,I'm in NC and I started buying my K Beauty products from US companies because the 45 plus day wait from the FDA is crazy. The Kentucky port is getting so backed up they are ruining packages. I didn't take the chance. I'm waiting on a jewelry package now I spent 400 on for my husband a ring. It's been 2 weeks and I'm still waiting for an update on shipping because they are so backed up. I guess they didn't realize a lot of mail come from other countries. The government shut down probably won't help either. They shelves are about to be empty.,1
부정,Thanks! I’ll try them. I have bad A.D.D. so the waiting kills me 🤣,3
중립,"Check beforehand whether OY covers the custom duties because as far as i know, they dont. That makes yesstyle worth it. Stylevana takes ages to arrive so i dont order from them. Yesstyle is my go to and takes 15 days max",1
중립,Ooh I haven’t heard of them. Thx!,1
긍정,Love them. I bought my Booster Pro from them.,1
중립,I ordered last week and it’ll be here today. I ordered from YesStyle and I waited a month :’),1
중립,[deleted],1
중립,OY charges extra 15% to the order to cover tariffs so it can be sent DDP (and theoretically no more extra fees).,1
중립,Did you have to pay tariffs? ;(,1
긍정,"Omg the next day would be a dream, but I know that’s unrealistic for the US so I’d be happy with 5. That happened to me with my last order from YesStyle. I ordered like 8 things and didn’t even remember what I ordered. It felt like Christmas 🤣",1
부정,"They have a 15% rule. You pay 15% of your order & nothing else. However with all their sales, points and coupons - I’ve found it to be not bad at all.",2
중립,With all the tariffs.. it may be cheaper in Korea. Plus you may get 1+1 deals and a ton of samples. 🥳 you also should consider the exchange rate too.,7
중립,"I recently visited Seoul and stocked up on all my favorite skincare products. Most of them were only a third to half the price of what I usually pay in Europe, so it made sense to buy them while I was in Korea anyway.
Whether it would make sense to travel there just to shop for skincare with the goal of saving money, I’m not sure.",5
중립,"as someone who bought skincare in korea (olive young), some products are much cheaper there than yesstyle, etc and the staff can also help you pick out your products based on your preferences and skin concerns. and as another person said, you can get 1+1 deals and free samples based on the products you picked out!",2
중립,"You don’t say where you’re from. They’re cheaper in Korea than in the US and the experience of visiting a department store or an Olive Young is worthwhile. Maybe 30% less expensive, which like, I’m not buying thousands of dollars of products so…. It’s not an impactful amount, for me.",2
긍정,If you are going korea then offcourse buy from there but if not then buy from trusted shop . I shop from MercelBay and have been pretty much good . ,2
긍정,"There s no way to tell you if it's enough.
If your skin looks happy with that then good, if you encounter any skin problem let us know what and we may be able to recommend some products.
Sometimes less is more, and if your skin is happy with that, your wallet is too :)",1
긍정,"My am routine is rinse, toner pad (switch between isntree onion & skin 1004 centella), BOJ spf
Pm routine is double cleanse (dr. A balm & roundlab birch), toner pad, HA serum, active (switch between azelaic acid 10% from TO & rx tret .25%), an oil serum from YINA (i love this brand), and an occlusive (LRP cica baume or a tallow based cream) 

I think using a richer cream or occlusive to lock in hydration from a mask or serum at night is really helpful for winter time even if u have oily skin",1
중립,"MAJOR MOISTURIZER SEASON!!! I can’t give you any specific brands atm, but I moisturize as normal but I usually carry another in my purse for reapplication during the day!",1
중립,Not sure about the other products but I’ve never found Burt’s bees products to work. I swear they leave me more chapped. ,2
긍정,"What is your skin type, and what type of skin issues are you trying to address? 

This would not be enough for me in the winter. Since you're asking specifically about winter, I'm going to guess you might have dry skin in the winter? I have a similar issue (but I also have rosacea, which makes my skin barrier challenging).

In my opinion, a good winter skin routine is something like this:

1. Wash

2. First essence (something like Mixsoon Bean Essence or ma:nyo bifida biome toner)

3. A milky toner that's a bit richer (maybe Purito Oat In Silky Toner or Tirtir milk toner)

4. Moisturizer (I really like Skin1004 Enrich Cream)

At night, a thin occlusive on top to keep water from evaporating from your skin overnight. Something like Abib Rice Probiotics Overnight Masks is really good.

The ""first essence"" gives you very gentle exfoliating and skin barrier support. The milky toner gives you a bit more richness. Moisturizer is to add lipids and richer ingredients on top. And the occlusive keeps your skin from losing water - we tend to lose a lot of water from our skin at night.",2
긍정,"Depends on your skin. If you’re oily, serums might be plenty. But I’d consider adding a moisturizer as well. I love the celimax dual barrier cream!",1
중립,"??wait, don't you know the Tamisense?",1
긍정,wow...thank you so much for advising!! I used to use the milky toner but it was very thick and oily for me. maybe i just don't like the texture. any other solutions?,1
중립,I’ve never used it. But I’ve used Burt’s bees and I regret it every time ,1
중립,small amount as blush or minimalist eyeshadow? or mix with another tint for a gradient,1
중립,Hmm i did see a tutorial on diluting lip products with concealer. Will try that thanxx,1
긍정,"I've been singing the praises of Erborian for the past year. I believe their bb cream is silicone free. It blurs better than anything I've ever used. I dont even wear full coverage foundation anymore. I just use this bb and a spot concealer, and my skin looks amazing.",1
중립,"Huda, caliray I think milani too. Many silicone free options",1
중립,"I use A'Pieu start up pore primer, silky and lightweight with a visible blurring effect on my pores - have repurchased :)",1
중립,"Oh, thank you! I had never heard Erborian before, but seems it is widely available here. Will give it a try, the price ain't bad either!",1
중립,whats your skin type?,1
중립,"Dry, but prone to some breakouts near my period. Otherwise sensitive. I have eczema and psoriasis.",2
긍정,Toss it for sure. Any changes in color or smell means it's not safe anymore. Don't play around with your eyes. PAO for most eye products with an applicator is 3-6 months for a good reason,5
긍정,"ahh I see so many things I have and love!! the mediheal madecassoside toner pads are so nice, I adore the smell. I also got the hydrating and collagen ones coming this week and I'm excited to try! also pls lmk how you like the dr g red blemish essence!",4
긍정,when you use the mediheal tea tree mask let me know how it feels! I can never find good reviews cause most of the time they are sponsored 🥲,2
긍정,"I haven’t tried most of these products before, so I’d love to know what you all think of them! I have dry sensitive skin and i’m trying to switch to a k beauty routine so for skincare I got-


TirTir Ceramic Cream, RED blemish Clear soothing active essence, mediheal pads in madecassoside, collagen and watermide, several mediheal masks, and round lab birch juice sunscreen plus free samples


For makeup:

Rom& glasting water gloss, peripera ink velvet, clio superproof pen liner, clio kill cover conceal palette, rom& milk tea velvet tint, etude water tint, fwee blurry pudding pot, touch in sol no pore blem primer, and the laneige smores kiss set!!",1
긍정,"The Fwee pudding pots are currently my favs. I bought 5-6 pots of it now. 
I love those toner pads you’ve got too.",1
중립,How much did it cost??,1
긍정,happy to report the blemish essence and madecosside have seemed to do my skin good! my redness has gone down significantly and my texture looks a tiny bit better as well. the ceramic cream seemed to be a bit heavy on my skin and causing redness unfortunately so i went back to my Dime blue facial oil as moisturizer and that seems to be working well for now at least,2
긍정,"oooh awesome!!! i’m excited to try them too!! a kbeauty store was having a closing sale so i got a great deal on all three, idk if i should use them all at once alternatively depending on what benefit i need that day? the store lady’s main recommendation was the collagen.

but yeah i’m dealing with horrible dryness and breakouts despite using multiple moisturizers so I’m hoping these products will be the switch i needed to make !!",1
중립,"I’m honestly so scared of masks bc my skin is SO sensitive 😭😭 but the lady said they’re recommended for younger sensitive skin. i will lyk!! sadly the ceramic cream didn’t seem to agree with me so that’s already one down:,)",1

중립,"300 ish total for all this at 3 different kbeauty stores in California Marketplace in Ktown, Los Angeles- did i pay too much lol",2
긍정,This is so great to hear!!!!!! Off I go to add the essence to my cart lol,1
중립,"i do layer my toners! i'll use the madecassoside and then pat a collagen toner pad on after that for extra hydration. if you're dealing with dryness, i'd first use the hydrating toner pad (gently wiping it) and then pat your collagen pad on your face once it's absorbed! use the madecassoside for when you're about to get a pimple or having irritation/breakouts (I use it daily cause im a sensitive skin girly) and you can def use the essence after your toner after it's absorbed!! :)",1
중립,"I would advise against using the toner pads altogether at once. Finish up one first before opening a new container. 

Do they not sell refills of the toner pads? You could next time just buy the refills and wash/dry the container before refilling to avoid contamination.",0
중립,"3 stores in los angeles koreatown, they were all in California Marketplace- Aritaum, Nature Collection and  Doginbi, paid $300 for all this",2
중립,Try the Wakemake blurring pots too if you haven’t. They are so cheap and I bought all the colours!,1
부정,"300$ for all this isn’t very bad(considering tariffs and whatnot) 

But I would say u could def get double the amount if done online ",1
중립,Why do you say so? Just so you don’t overwhelm your skin?,1
긍정,"This is a fixing spray. It’s a really good ultrafine mist fixing spray, I’m currently using this.

Setting sprays melt your makeup together, fixing sprays fixes your makeup.

I use setting sprays on my sponge then blend my makeup, and a fixing spray as the last step in my makeup to hold everything together.",3
중립,"Do you use **Hwahae Global**? It’s not really widely used yet, is it?",2
중립,I fell for the hype and this did absolutely NOTHING 🥲,2
중립,"I’m sorry, but it literally is called “fixx” and says “all day right makeup setting.” It is a fixing spray.",3
중립,ty,1
긍정,"Ultrafine mist is a stretch. Just got it, it's really nice but I actually found the mist to be too ""big""  not fine at all",0
중립,"Yes, I use it. I don't really check the reviews, just the Korea/Global ranking. 
I don't have a Korean pass number, so I can only use the global one, but is kinda incomplete.",1
중립,"I'm sorry but your other comment just disappeared, can u send me a screenshot of it? I can only see that you talked about polyester-5",1
중립,Maybe you got a fake or it doesn't work with your son type?. This is literally the only fixing spray I've ever used that worked. I have oily skin too. Wish I could still order direct from their website,1
중립,"??? Are you sure? I’ve been using it for months and it’s fine mist. All the descriptions online also mention ultrafine, microfine etc.
I’ve used other sprays like Urban Decay, Charlotte Tilbury, Shu Uemura etc, and I can guarantee that Fixx is the finest out of them.",1
중립,I bought it on Yesstyle so doubt it was a fake :(,1
중립,"I have the mini version, maybe it's not the same as the regular one? Or maybe my expectation for an ultrafine mist are too high",1
중립,"Mayhaps haha, the mist feels like when there’s a waterfall, and the water mist is in the area.",1
긍정,Hi there 👋 This product looks legit to me. It's normal to have multi european language because it's mendatory to sell in EU (If you live in Italy it must have the labels in Italian). So it's actually a good sign. Most of fake products come from china and doesn't have the european package.,6
중립,"Write anua and send them these pictures. If your only evidence is that you “heard” Amazon sells fakes, that isn’t much to go on. Anua sells direct on Amazon. If you are paranoid about fakes, buy from the website directly. 

No one can look at these photos and tell you this is inauthentic *except* for anua.",5
중립,"Not necessarily, like other posters have said, could be due to requirements in your country/region for selling cosmetics. However, I would caution you against getting anything you put on your body (like cosmetics and skincare) or anything you ingest off Amazon. Amazon warehouses often store all products of a kind together, regardless of the seller. So even if you buy from a brand’s official storefront on Amazon, if there is someone also selling a counterfeit version of that product, you might get that instead. Better to buy from retailers that only get products directly from the brand and not from a website where basically anyone can sell things.",3
중립,Should have a batch number on the box/jar you can look up on checkfresh.com or you can also compare the ingredients on their official website and see if they match.,1
긍정,"As others have mentioned, it’s very normal for brands to over label or put stickers on the products as the instructions need to be in the language of the country the item is being sold in. Best to check with Anua themselves though",1
중립,"For a quick solution, go to [Anua’s official website](https://anua.com/products/niacinamide-10-txa-4-serum-2), and download or screenshot a picture of the bottle front and back. If they don’t have a picture of the back, the front should be enough. Fake brands have to alter labels, images, and text on the bottle to avoid being sued. Look at your bottle, and zoom in on the screenshots, comparing both. If everything is exactly the same, you have an authentic product. If there are any differences, even as subtle as a dot somewhere that does not appear on the bottle in the screenshot, then it is fake, and you should return it ASAP.

To avoid this in the future, when shopping for skincare on Amazon, look under the “Add the cart”, and “buy now” buttons. You will see some information that includes; ships from, sold by, returns, gift options. Make sure that it is SOLD BY the brand itself, or says something like “Anua official”. Not something crazy like “fjtieaodytnyogisbwyeignri” or “Jane’s Lane”, regardless of the seller’s ratings. Many brands will also have a link on their website that lists verified retailers. If Amazon is not included, I would look elsewhere.

I know it is tempting, especially when there are deals on Amazon you don’t see otherwise, but spending the money on an authentic product is absolutely 110% worth saving yourself from unknown, potentially harmful impurities in fake products. Even if this serum is authentic, I would not risk buying from that store again. The next serum might be fake.

I used to buy VT Cos Reedle Shots from Amazon, I have purchased at least 7 bottles. One of those bottles arrived totally empty, another came broken and would not pump, and a third was fake. That’s when I quit buying skincare from Amazon entirely.

If you are still tempted, go on social media and search “reaction fake skincare”. That should change your mind. 🥰",1
중립,No,1
중립,Can you recommend any Micellar water that I could use with these? I plan to change up my routine soon,2
중립,Lwkey i might give the anua toner a chance after saying it feels like slapping water,2
중립,"Oh, what’s Micellar Water? Could you tell me what it is?",1
긍정,Bioderma the best ( the pink one) .,1
긍정,"Yeah, it’s pretty easy to use. Doesn’t cause any breakouts and feels perfect for hydrating the skin.",1
중립,"Say nothing, take the win. The error is on their part and they can correct it if they wish. Wait a month before spending the credits if you're worried they'll remove it from your account. Pointing out the error may get someone else in trouble.

긍정,"Try Numbuzin No 9 toner and the lifting essence. They really give you a great glow. And you can use any moisturizer on top that you want. My favorite moisturizer is the Medik8 Advanced Pro-collagen + Peptide Cream. It has a GF (growth factor) mini protein & NAD+. It moisturizes beautifully and gives noticeable tightening and lifting. It's not cheap ($88), but you can get $25 off on the Shop app.",3
긍정,"I love the Real Extreme Barrier cream, I also like Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Cream.  I use tje Real Barrier mostly on tret nigromante.  They also have an amazing Extrem Cream mask that is my go to for when tret dehydrates me a bit too much.",2
긍정,Ongredients skin barrier calming lotion seems like a good option for you. I like it because it’s non sticky and does give a glowy look to the skin. Moisturizing as well plus all clean ingredients!,2
긍정,Real Barrier Extreme Cream is my holy grail night cream. I use the Real Barrier Extreme Lotion for daytime. I love it so much that I have a drawer full of about 10 refills that I bought from YesStyle before the tariffs hit. You can find it on Amazon but it’s like 2x the price.,2
중립,"My all time favorite is chasin rabbits golden ruler, or drjart yellow tube",1
중립,"I think the real barrier cream has too many extracts/ essential oils in it for daytime wear. But aesura, zeroid, and illiyoon have the same ceramide technology without the additional extracts, so they are similar and preferable to me.

For glowiness, I recommend Biodance essence glow moisturizer. Or, you can just layer humectants under any moisturizer (unless it’s matte) and get a glowy look.",1
중립,"I recently just started the beplain cicaterol capsule barrier cream. It hasn’t clogged or broke me out, and my skin looks glowy afterwards (and isn’t sticky!). Idk why ppl recommend the dr althea 147 barrier cream; from the texture alone, it disqualifies as a barrier cream to me. I’ve previously used aestura (old formula), but it gave me milia (haven’t tried new formulation).",1

I have very dry skin, can be very sensitive too & clog prone but i do use chemical exfoliants, and this cream has been a game changer for me.
It's the cream that i use for tretinoin nights and the day after, it helped my skin barrier so much.
Someone recommended the ongredients lotion and it's been one of my fav too. It's very nourishing and soothing, not sure it will be enough for my skin during winter cold days as i started using it during spring",1

I’m on my 2nd tube now in about 6 months.I kept breaking out for WEEKS in 1 spot on my cheek. (It’s a whole different story, I was going through some health issues that caused acne/stress) either way, this cream cleared up my breakouts fast and without leaving scarring. It’s lightweight, and can be used alone for a moisturizer. I personally will wash, tone, use the 147 cream, and a light moisturizer on top. It has been lovely! And it’s easy to find on Amazon.",0
중립,"The Numbuzin lifting essence is a bit sticky until it absorbs, so you may want to use it at night. My glow doesn't go away. When I get out of the shower, my glow is still there. 

Regarding the Medik8 moisturizer, it really produces visible results in less time than other options. That claim is substantiated by not only me but also a few of my friends. My friends turned me on to it.",2
중립,i used the illiyoon and it was just a waxy film that sat on top of my skin instead of actually hydrating it. im gonna look into these cream mask too! would you say its a glowy and thick cream?,1

The mask feels super moisgturizing to me.",1

I have dry, acne-prone skin (I would also say clog-prone). I do retinal 3x a week, exfoliate with a dermaplane and AHA pad 1x a week. The other nights are heavy hydration and barrier recovery products. 

I’m happy to send you my full routine if you’d like. Just need a way to send screen shots of it in my notes app.",1

긍정,Illyoon is occlusive. Using it along is going to do more harm than good. ,1
긍정,You can try other moisturizer but there is no perfect moisturizer. Every skin is different. You can add up a hydrating toner and layer it twice. Betaglucan is a good humectant give it some time to work. I would consider adding oil to your moisturizer at night. I have dry skin and I add oil in my routine.,1
중립,"Hi, my skin is very sensitive especially to moisturizers. How hydrating I need my moisturizer to be depends on the weather and also where I am living. I have always found it easy and had to layer the moisturizers. So please try that. Try one of the ones that already works and something else for repairing your skin barrier which seems to be damaged. 
I found Torriden Solid in Ceramide cream lightweight and moisturizing and depending on the need, I need to layer. Ceramides help with damaged barrier so I am trying this too. And also if there is redness and inflammation you can also look at something with cica. ",1
긍정,i use a really good humectant and have bought a toner but the moisturizer itself is just waxy and overall not good. i want something more hydrating and glowy instead of creating a weird dry film,1
긍정,"thank you so much!! i did this for a while but it got expensive quick and i dont really have any that worked properly, ill look into the torriden tysmnn❤️",1
긍정,Torriden is so good frfr,1

중립,Ingredients,9
중립,Ingredients,6
중립,I use the excess as a serum for a few days afterwards. I just keep the open packet propped up on my vanity and pour a bit out when I want to use it. Haven’t had any issues yet but usually chuck it out after a couple of days.,6
중립,Ingredients because I recently bought a few that are TOO juicy and it feels annoying and wasteful. I’ve been kind of squeezing the mask out as I remove it and saving the juice in a clean travel container to use on my body with body lotion but that’s annoying.,3
중립,"I have masks for different uses, I have one that I use consistently on weekly basis, some specifically to use pre-event, post-sun exposure etc.",2
중립,"Depends on why I'm sheet masking. 


Prepping for a big event? Any hydrogel will do. 


Hydration? Will pick based on long-lasting hydration/amount of serum and sheet mask feel/quality


Overexfoliated/irritated? Damn straight I'm looking at ingredients. Madecassoside please!",2
부정,"Ingredients do matter to me a lot, and really determine which sheet mask I choose for what concern. However, texture is also really important to me for sensory reasons, so if it feels bad it's not going to be something that I will repurchase.",1
중립,Are sheet mask serums the same concentration as their bottled version?,1
중립,"Tbh I stopped buying. What I do now is apply my favorite serum to my face and then diy a mask (soak a dry / compressed face mask in a mix of warm water + glycerin). This way I reduce the price per mask. Even though you get a lot of product in the face mask it seldom has enough preservative to save for later use. 

At the end of the day what I want from a sheet mask is hydration, which I feel that I achieve with this diy version, and the benefits from the actives I get from my regular skincare products.",1
중립,Definitely ingredients- that’s the only way to be sure what it’s going to do to your skin and tailor for what you need right now.,1
긍정,Same! Love the YINA biocellulose masks for this (their c beauty but the best mask ive found for healing and brightening),2
중립,Recommend TAMISENSE Sheet Mask,1
중립,Have you ever tried TAMISENSE Mask?,1
중립,They are a more wasteful version of a serum for the most part.,1
중립,I think so..? That's actutally I prefer sheet mask with a lot of serum in one mask,1
중립,What's your favorite serum?,1
중립,My favorite is the purito centella unscented serum! :) very hydrating and calming on my periodically sensitive and irritated skin (use adapalene / benzoyl peroxide to treat acne).,1
중립,"Aestura Atobarrier line / Dr Jart+ Ceramidin line

Both are medical beauty brands. Developed by dermatologists and recommended by dermatologists.",2
중립,"Your description is basically me + sensitive skin and I’m super lazy. I can’t really be bothered with a bunch of products and anything with too many ingredients messes with my skin so I’m definitely not an expert.

With that being said, my skin really likes the basic [COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence](https://www.ulta.com/p/advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence-xlsImpprod15641052?sku=2504912) and I use it almost everyday. I recommend you try out some discovery kits like this [COSRX](https://www.ulta.com/p/viral-preppair-kit-pimprod2045109?sku=2624299) or [Peach & Lily](https://www.ulta.com/p/glass-skin-discovery-kit-pimprod2014552?sku=2561116) (I just bought this and my skin has been liking it so far).",1
긍정,"Just quickly: Glass skin can be achieved easily by layering humectants (toners, essences, and serums) heavily and sealing them in with a glossy moisturizer (or non-matte moisturizer). Mists sprayed over the whole thing when you’re done can help even more. The key is layering the humectants first until your skin looks dewy. 

That’s a cosmetic approach to the glass-skin look. But a more holistic and natural approach is to get your skin barrier in tip-top shape. When your barrier is in good shape, your skin will have a natural bounce and elasticity, which will make it look soft and dewy.

For both approaches, it is helpful to add ferments to the list of humectants. Ferments make your skin glow if you layer them. Missha 5x revolution, benton fermentation essence, and mixsoon galactomyces are all glow-makers. The glow will heighten the glass-skin effect, and ferments are generally good for skin conditioning in general. 

I made of list of glowy products a while back, maybe it will help: https://www.reddit.com/r/PeptidesProducts/s/FDr3Yccrtf",1
중립,"Since your skin leans very dry and gets flaky in winter, I’d start with barrier-focused hydration before layering anything too active. A lot of people jump into K-beauty essences or toners, but what actually helps long term is replenishing the lipid balance. Look for oils or serums that combine squalane, moringa, borage, or marula — these mimic the skin’s natural sebum and deeply hydrate without heaviness.

I formulate small-batch skincare myself, and the biggest mistake I see is skipping nourishment for the barrier. When you give the skin the right fatty acids and antioxidants, it naturally starts to look like “glass skin” because it’s balanced — not because it’s coated in layers. Try introducing one nourishing oil under your moisturizer at night and you’ll probably see smoother texture within a week.",1
긍정,"You don’t need to know all the technical terms. What matters is finding products that suit you. Make sure to use a moisturizing cream, and for sunscreen, choose one that’s rich in hydration!  
sun: Mary & May Cica Suncream, Round Lab  
cream: Torriden Dive-In, Physiogel, Kiehl’s. all great moisturizing creams.",1

PM: double cleanse, then use a retinoid 3–4 nights/week alternating with azelaic or tranexamic acid for hyperpigmentation, add PHA or lactic acid 1–2x weekly for texture, and buffer with humectants and barrier soothers like snail mucin or propolis.",2
중립,"What works for one person may not work for the next, even if they have similar skin needs. Texture can be addressed in different ways, though you may want to look at aha bha for that. Pigmentation - may be look into vitamin C as it’s a known brightener",1

중립,"Centella-based, low pH, sulfate-free foaming cleansers can help calm redness as long as they don’t leave your skin feeling tight, so patch test first.

긍정,The PAO is 12 months and it has a very watery consistency. It's great for redness but it's not hydrating at all just fyi,2
중립,"PAO is 12 months after opening, the texture is watery/toner-like (not oily) and sinks in fast so it works well before SPF with little to no pilling, I like it for calming redness, and if you won’t use it daily choose a smaller size instead of 100 ml; more info at coreaskincare com.",1
중립,In korea hair perm that looks like S shapes waves is really popular so the only actual way to get hair like that it get that perm in korea,23
중립,Have you tried letting your hair dry in braids? That’s what I do and it’s the most low maintenance way to get waves. The hair in the photos is definitely either heat styled or permed (or both).,34
중립,If your hair takes processing well a korean or japanese perm will give you this,5
중립,A wave iron would achieve the first picture,8

중립,Try rollers,2
중립,Korean digital perm,2
중립,Have you tried doing sock curls?,2
중립,"I think this first pic is my hair. Second pic is usually heat made imo. I have a couple pieces that curl kinda barrel like you said, but most do this wave. I’ve learned that frizz is inevitable with wavy hair because we just don’t have the stronger shape to keep it down. I don’t mind it, I like it. 

Idk what it is you want, and I don’t feel like reading it again. It sounds like you don’t like it when it’s too freshly tight, just use a light oil and scrunch it out. I live where it’s cold and dry so I don’t wash daily, so for extra hold I use olaplex curl gel/ verb curl cream (the old version ONLY. new orange line sucks). The first day is very shiny and tidier. I wash at night and dry only my roots, so I sleep with my hair wet and splay it above my head when I sleep and it’s pretty curly and voluminous when I wake.",2
긍정,"I am korean and had that hairstyle, have both tried heat styling straight hair and perming. To perfectly replicate the models in the photos, it has to be heated styled. Perm alone does not give perfect blocks of wavy hair like the second pic. But loose perms called 구름펌 can achieve similar looks using some blow dryer skills and curl cream. With only perm and no styling it just becomes fuzzy.",2
중립,"If you have a hairdresser who is Korean, Chinese, or Japanese, ask if they can do it. Digital perm is quite popular for quite some time (more than 10 yrs Id say) in that part of Asia. So if you have a China town or anything similar nearby, chances of finding a digital perm place is high.",2
중립,"Hello! The first picture will be more called a bubble wave perm~ 

[Onyad Jimin](https://www.instagram.com/onyad_jimin?igsh=ZmU3ZzVvMmNicm0z) specialises in this kind of perm if you ever find yourself in korea or need more inspo~",2
중립,I had this type of hair before i bleached,1
중립,"i own the vodana wave clamp iron and it gives this look, but im not sure how it would work on already wavy hair",1
긍정,"I see a lot of people mentioning perms, but if you're not necessarily wanting this style every single day, you might try using a beachy wave/texturizing spray or leave in cream. Believe it or not, there are some good ones that don't make your hair crunchy. I mention this because you already have some wave to your hair, so it shouldn't take much to achieve this style. Just use a volumizer at your roots and scrunch up your hair in handfuls toward your scalp when it's damp after applying the texturizing/beach  wave product and it should dry just the way you want it. I'm actually jealous of your barrel waves haha the style you want is my natural wave but I'm always longing for loose barrel curls 😆",1
중립,Weavy Perm. Or u may Buy weavy form from wella,1
중립,Buy an expensive wig.,1
중립,I appreciate you!,1
중립,"I'm 2a, my hair gets very frizzy. Cantu Wave Whip Curling Mousse makes my natural hair look like your first picture. It doesn't make it crunchy at all. I swear by it, but you have to use it on wet hair and use conditioner. My hair looked so different when I started using that people asked me if I did a perm. 

Also, for me at least, 'S' waves appeared when I got a layered haircut.",1
중립,"My hair gets similar curls from my sleeping hairstyle. Twist the hair (the whole length) and put it at the same time in a bun.
It you twist it tightly, the curls are smaller/tighter. 
When you comb it, the curls get looser again. 
Don’t twist the ends too strong or the curls in the last few cm will get a bit too tight.",1
중립,Asking for a friend - but does that perm actually turn out as it looks on relatively fine textured hair?,1
중립,Korean perm,1
중립,Beachwaver maybe,1
중립,Looks like “hippie perm”,1
중립,I have a Bed Head crimper that makes my very straight and fine hair look so similar to this! I use it once a week and the crimps last until my next wash about 2-3 days later (i get compliments every time i use it!),1
긍정,I would say try Korean hair products. Kundal shampoo and conditioner has a good reputation amongst Korean people with naturally curly hair. The mise en scene curl essence is an affordable leave in cream to do away with frizz.,0
중립,[removed],-3
긍정,"Yeah I think I’ll try that! I thought of trying it but I wanted to post on Reddit to see what other people would say first. And yeah their hairs definitely heat styled, and honestly I wouldn’t mind heat styling but I just don’t have the tools for it and I can’t find any tutorials either. If i wanted hair like this but more permanently would perming be a good option? I have wavy hair so I just would want to change the shape of the waves instead",3
중립,Do you do multiple braids?,1
중립,"No no braids do not give these specific curls. These are big curls, braids give more of a smaller dry beach waves look. Look up braid curls OP",1
중립,"Thing is I already have wavy hair so I’m wondering how this would work? And even then I’d have to style it, wouldn’t it just be better to style my natural hair?",3
중립,Ohh like those weird irons that you kinda clamp onto ur hair? I saw one a while ago. If it’s that do you have recommendations?,1
중립,And how would that work exactly?,1
중립,Yep this is the answer,1
중립,My hair looks like the second pic without heat but I also did get it permed at a Korean salon,1
중립,Ugh same and now I have a weird non wave non straight hair lol,1
중립,I was considering buying that! Does it work well?,2
긍정,Thank you for the suggestion! And we should totally switch LMAO s shape waves seem so much easier to handle,2
중립,Do you have any recommendations for a spray/cream?,1
중립,"Does ur natural hair have an s shape or a barrel shape? Because I’m worried that using a mousse would just make my barrel curls more defined instead of giving me the s shape, and it might only work for you since you already have that. And I do have a layered cut, which makes my hair look more voluminous and curly, but still not s shaped",1
중립,Yeah a perm would be able to do that!,3
중립,I do 2!,1
중립,Braid waves can look kinda similar to the first pic. But yeah that’s why I said they’re likely heat styled or permed lol,1
중립,"doing it will change the shape of your curl pattern to a looser wave and technically you shouldn't have to do much styling once the perm is in place compared to trying to loosen up your own waves each time you wash it.

If you aren't doing anything to it at all right now, try the braiding technique mentioned in another comment. If you don't like the results you could try a perm later on.",3
중립,I use the revlon 3 barrel waver it’s like a big crimper. Super easy,1
중립,"it does, i purchased it on amazon (i think) and it has a US plug so i don’t need a converter. i use it on the weakest settings and it works well on 1b hair",2
긍정,"I've had good luck with the Ouai brand both the wave spray and the curl creme, but my sister really likes the Living Proof texture spray. YMMV, but the Ouai ones have always left my hair soft, which I really appreciate because some texture sprays can be crunchy and no one wants that!",1
중립,"I would say my natural hair is super uneven - It has a ton of barrel curls combined with some naturally 'S' shaped, like more elongated (?) waves, and in other sections is almost completely straight. 

Sometimes - and I mean, on the very odd day that my hair decides to cooperate, I can get my hair looking like your second picture, but that definitely involves heat (a VERY wide curler) and some anti-frizz oil. 

You have a point here, but maybe you could try, Cantu is pretty unexpensive and even if it doesn't work, you might use it as a styling product if you decide to use heat to get the hairstyle you prefer.",2
중립,For sure — a perm would work perfectly for that look.,1
중립,I appreciate you!,1
중립,"Tirtir is notorious for oxidizing, I bought like 4 diff shades in their mid 20s range when I was trying to shade match, and yet they all made me turn orange at the end of the day lol. If you don’t want to waste it, what worked for me was adding either a lighter foundation or a blue or white mixer into the cushion. If not, Unleshia has a good cushion that doesn’t oxidize. 32N might work for you?",1
중립,"I use the TirTir Aura Cushion Foundation (silver packaging) in shade 29N. It does not oxidize on my skin like the red one did, and it is much easier to apply. The finish is semi-sheer and slightly dewy. In fact, I like the Aura so much that I bought a couple of backups.",1
중립,[removed],1
긍정,"Since you really like the shade match, you could also try adding a drop or two of a green (green counters orange/red) neutralizing color corrector or using a green shaded tone up base. Many brands make color correctors that will do a great job, but make sure you get a liquid one and not a cream so you can blend it with your foundation. Jung Saem Mool and d'Alba both have green tone up bases, and I know there are several liquid color correctors as well, but I can't remember the brands off the top of my head. 

If you're looking for other foundation brands, the Hera and Jung Saem Mool cushions have a very good reputation for the quality of their formulas and for not oxidizing, although both are a bit pricey.

Good luck! 🙂",1
긍정,chanel foundation will not oxidize! i use matte liquid bottle and have been using for 2 years and still only used like 1/4. little goes a long way. in terms of korean brands: i use banila and romand. i heard clio was good. coming from a korean :),1

긍정,"It might still be worth checking to see if there's a match for you in the JSM cushion cuz I'm suuuper pale and it hasn't been too orange for me in their lightest shade, but of course YMMV!

긍정,"Ginseng is actually really well studied in Asia. Korea has regulations for it as an ingredient and treats traditional/holistic medicine as an equivalent to western medicine. The big name companies (Amorepacific, LG, Kolmar) have facilities dedicated to researching it and other hanbang ingredients. Ginseng is a great antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. It also stimulates collagen production which makes it a popular anti-aging ingredient in the older crowd


Sulwahsoo's overnight vitalizing mask is amazing. I wake up with soft, buttery skin the next morning. And it smells so good! Like orange ginger",11
중립,"I really like beauty of joseon’s ginseng toner and sulwhasoo’s ginseng renewing cream. My face is clearer and brighter, I think in part bc of it. Sulwhasoo is really spendy but it’s my treat to myself (plus I’m over 50 and my face needs it haha).",7
중립,"Oh, I’ve heard a lot about that product! My mom used to use ginseng products from another brand.",1
중립,Ginseng is a known anti-aging ingredient with scientific backing in the East and West. It does indeed work.,1
긍정,"The centella ginseng biocellulose mask from YINA is so amazing, it heals irritation for me so well, and there’s so much essence in a single mask pack that I can make it last a few nights for me (not reusing the mask, just saving the leftover essence)",1
긍정,"I've tried Sulwhasoo and Donginbi, and I do really like the Sulwhasoo line, but I sadly  had to stop using the cream because I started a retinoid and it has retinol in it. They do make a mask version, though, and I LOVE that before special occasions. It gives me my best skin ever for like eight hours. 

From Donginbi, I really only felt like the oil was worth it, but I have trouble fitting an oil into my current routine so I haven't repurchased.",1

중립,I also like the ginseng toner from joseon :),1
중립,It is well-studied in the West too!,1
긍정,Wooh great deep knowledge.,1
중립,Findation is a shade matching app.,1
긍정,"Hey there! If you've been wearing classic ivory, you're probably a pale girlie like me, and I can recommend TirTir's red cusion in shades between 10c shell and 17c porcelain. It just depends how pale you are/whether your undertone is cool, neutral, or warm. Some people say they tend to oxidize over the day, so you might go one shade lighter than you'd think you need.

Also, Jung Saem Mool in their 13 series shades or the lightest of their 17 series shades (their shades are numbered like TirTir's with multiple undertone options per shade number) is a really lovely formula.

Lastly, if you're down for the splurge, the Hera black cushion in 13N1, 17N1, or 17C1 is awesome.

I've also heard good things about Banila Ultimate White cushion and Clio as more budget friendly options, but I haven't tried them yet.

Another thing to note if you're making your first jump to cushion foundations is that using a spatuala and mixing with a bit of BB cream (the Missha Perfect Cover and the FusionCell C are my faves), blending outward from the center of the face in thin layers, and then using a damp beauty blender sponge to press it in and absorb any excess is sort of the ultimate k beauty perfect skin base method, but if you're just looking for an easy press on and go for the daily, you don't need to do all that! 

Hope that helps 🙂",1
긍정,Thank you! Though it doesn’t let me see the tirtir brand specifically it will help me narrow down the shade more on their site as well,1
긍정,Thank you so much for the in depth info! I’m not super pale but definitely on the fair side so the oxidation may work in my favour! I’m learning I have a lot of pink undertones but like a warm peachy pink. I think I’ll take a look at your suggestions and try them out too as I do like to splurge a bit!,1
중립,Ulta's website has a shade finder that you can use specifically for tirtir foundation. You just go to the foundation's page and then input your color in foundations that you currently use.,1
긍정,Thank you! I’ve been able to narrow it down and now I’m lucky enough to that I’ll be going to a sukoshi mart brick and mortar location this week with my bf so I can swatch in person. It’s given me a great starting point and I’m really excited to get to try before I buy!,2

긍정,That toner is so so good for oily skin i love it,1
긍정,I also use the big bottle of round lab toner. Although I somehow liked bioderma (the pink one) more. It does a great job still. Referring to your point 3: I hope you meant you’re using it only 3 times a week and not day 😃,1
긍정,"I second this! 

Face, neck, chest area, or even elbows? Freaking baaaathe in that toner. I’m onto my 3rd big bottle so that’s saying something. Sure, don’t expect magic, but for solid gentle hydration, it’s perfect. :)",2
중립,"Yes as far as I remember you’re right, according to my dermatologist :)",2

긍정,Thank you so much for your comment! Are you using any other thing of the same line? You convinced me to buy that toner cause it’s been on my cart forever but I wasn’t totally sure. So it’s the 500ml version worth it?,1
긍정,"You’re welcome! Yes, I used the round lab dokdo cream and lotion as well. Both are very nice, gentle and effective:).",1
긍정,"I have both the dokdo toner & cleanser!

Toner: hydrating, not much to say because it’s quite watery, but feels good to my skin and toners aren’t meant to do as much anyway!

Cleanser: love this cleanser. Didn’t leave skin dry, lathered up a bit, no unpleasant smell (unlike etude 5.5…smelled like soy sauce, yuck). Effective at cleansing closed comedones & some blackheads, didn’t cause any irritation or have any downsides. Will probably repurchase :)

Btw I have sensitive normal to combo skin.",1

중립,"Does anyone know a chemical sunscreen similar to the **SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum** that has less of a purple tint? I like this sunscreen because it's not very greasy or oily, but it's still hydrating. I'm black, so the tint is more noticeable on my skin. This concealer shade ""cafe"" is close to my skin tone. Could you please give recommendations based on what you've seen/noticed on more tanned or darker skin tones (at least somewhere close to mine)? I have acne-prone, dehydrated skin.

중립,"This might sound like a strange question because usually people with oily acne prone skin tend to gravitate towards gel or gel-cream textures. But as someone who has tried a few cream moisturizers (aestura, dr jart) that were marketed towards drier skin types, I loved the feeling and texture of the cream but have gotten breakouts after. So i’m just wondering whether a rich moisturizer but for oily acne prone skin exists?",2
중립,Aren't cleansers such as Eqqualberry Purple Rice Pore Cleanser or Blithe Bubbling Splash not for daily use?,1
긍정,"Does anyone have a good dupe/replacement for **Moonshot glassyfit cushion in shade 101**? Finally running out of my last one. Looking for a cushion with light/semi-sheer coverage (slightly buildable OK) and a glowy finish, preferably without a strong fragrance. For light cool-tone complexion, tendency to be quite pink and don't want to over-correct.

For color matching reference, including some non-AB to make it easier to find a color match, hope that's ok!  
AB: Missha Radiance Perfect Fit and Magic Cushion Cover in shade 21 are not a good color-match and were **too orange** on me, but Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream in 21 is a **good** shade match but slightly grey and matte (not glowy) and its fragrance is a bit much for me on sensitive days.  
Non-AB: MAC NC15 and KVD Light 006 are perfect shade matches.",1

I recently got a Korean “grace” perm (looser curls). First time getting a digital perm - how do y’all sleep with your perms to maintain the curl? I usually sleep with two braids on each side of my face but can’t do that anymore for fear of messing with the curl patterns.

Any insight on what sleep hairstyles to do, and maintenance ratios are welcomed!!!",1
중립,What is everyone HG non dewy sunscreen?,1
중립,Has anybody tried using orien products?,1
중립,"Strictly speaking, this sunscreen is chemical. 

Unfortunately, it contains the UV filter Tinsorb M (Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol). 

That UV filter comes in the form of a stark white insoluble powder, so it's just as bad as mineral UV filters on darker skin tones. Some people even consider it to be a ""hybrid filter"" for that reason. 

I'm also black, and I always advise people to look out for the specific problematic ingredients in products you're interested in rather than ask about white cast. Lots of people will just make a judgment call regarding white cast on their own skin, but by knowing the ingredients you can consistently avoid having issues. 

My personal favorite currently is the Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Aqua Fresh Sunscreen. Pretty much perfectly fits all of your criteria. I also love the Missha All Around Safe Block Sun Essence SPF 45. 

Just be careful about the names as BOJ has another sunscreen that also contains Tinsorb M, and Missha has a ton of sunscreens with very slightly different names.",5
중립,Maybe the Tony Moly Ceramide Mochi water cream?,1

중립,"By the way, where do you go to find out about this stuff? Do you follow cosmetic chemists online or something? Or do you read articles?",2
긍정,"I follow a few cosmetic chemists and influencers on Instagram/YouTube. 

I strongly prefer people with a science based approach. No ""clean beauty,"" no DIY, and little to no trend chasing. Ads are fine as long as they're upfront and properly disclosed. 

My favorite is Dr Michelle Wong, aka LabMuffin Beauty Science. But another amazing cosmetic chemist, especially for any skin tone related info, is Esther Olu, themelaninchemist on Instagram. 

Nowadays, there are quite a few black beauty professionals out there testing SPF for white cast, texture, finish, etc., but once I knew what to look out for, I didn't really find it necessary to follow anyone else's advice. I also live in Asia, so it's easy for me to try AB products.",2

I just had to toss out this palette because it developed mold :( Does anyone know a blush that matches the exact shade I'm looking for?",1
긍정,"Bruh the Canmake Marshmallow Finishing Powder (Not the Abloom one, haven't tried that) is actually really nice. Maybe it's just in my head, but it makes my skin look nice and blurred. It's a nice matte look too. I have a loose powder I had been using, but this one has become my favorite. I wear this even without foundation underneath.

I don't think it lasts as long as I would like it to, but when I reapply, it doesn't seem too cakey. Though, I am not the best person to compare with that, as I usually wear makeup for less than 8 hours.",1
중립,You can look at BBIA Downy Cheek cream blushes for such subtle shades.,1
긍정,"flower knows did some of these very light muted shades in their earlier collections! And i know peripera has similar shades in their fall releases, 16 or 31 look like they could be good matches (from experience they swatch lighter than they look in the pan, especially the squishy ones). lastly i'd suggest dasique, a lot of their blush palettes have a light voluming/blending shade like that!",0
중립,"OH also i just remembered more, joocyee's tortoiseshell blushes and judydoll's pretty blush powders have similar shades too!",1
긍정,"- SPF SPF SPF SPF SPF. Make sure you wear a hat or use a parasol if it’s really sunny. Your sunscreen is your last line of defence in the sun. Don’t bother with stick or spray, get a good old liquid sunscreen and slap a good amount on your face. The best sunscreen is whatever you will consistently so find a brand that you really like. I have been using Anessa Perfect Milk for 10+ years. 

- Vitamin C. Use whatever concentration your skin will tolerate, my skin is sensitive and I can’t use anything stronger than the Rohto Melano Premium Essence atm. 

- Skin usually gets dryer as you age so look into deep moisturizing products if you notice your skin drying out. Wrinkles are more obvious on dehydrated skin. I’m currently using the TIRTIR ceramic ampoule and moisturizer. 

- 

Lastly nothing beats not smoking and drinking, getting tons water, eating and sleeping well, eat collagen (bone broth or pork skin or whatever). You cant out moisturise a poor lifestyle 🤪",1
긍정,"for fine lines/sleep lines, i focus on prevention: i sleep in [these](https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA250933698) or similar a couple times a week and they really help with preventing fine lines in the morning from sleep. they're pricey though so sometimes i just use [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SWPBJ52?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1) overnight (or i just try to sleep on my back lol but i always turn over onto my side or stomach eventually!).

in terms of essences/lotions, i find keeping my moisture barrier intact and keeping my skin very moisturized has been huge for making my skin appear firmer and with fewer lines.

* any moisturizer with 5% urea is extremely, extremely loved by my skin, which is very dry and prone to irritation. the zeroid 5% urea cream is my holy grail, but also annoyingly expensive.
* i also really enjoy torriden's DIVE IN toner pads & their ceramide lotion (i can't recall the name but it's the one in the yellow bottle).
* abib collagen masks are amazing! i have tried a bunch of milky sheet masks since i got a huge haul when i was in seoul last month and have been really impressed by these

and it goes without saying: SUNSCREEN! sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen! make sure to reapply especially if you're outside or by a sunny window!

i also recently began microneedling at home & following it with rejuran dual effect ampoule for the c-PDRN, but i can't say how effective that will be for me yet!",1

중립,"yes it's a gel-like sachet that you eat daily. i take purest co's collagen glow berry (singaporean brand) and i've been using it for 1 month - it's yummy and i do think my skin is more glowy. they have a powder option, but the sachet is apparently the most potent (and priciest).

the only thing is that it is truly very expensive 🥲",1
긍정,thank you!! oof i see that price tag. what made you go with this brand over a cheaper alternative? i use a lot of topical collagen products and i might re-allocate that budget to supplements,1
긍정,"i've heard lots of good reviews (from acquaintances and online) and the type of collagen they use sounds good. the thing about collagen is that it's personal whether it works or not too, so i decided to try it for 3 months to see if i'll continue it long term and i'm leaning towards a resounding yes.

i don't use any topical collagen, so i figured i'll cut down on trying out new skincare stuff and focus on something that can really make a difference instead. i also always believe that supplements > topical products. 

11.11 is coming up, so it could be a good time to try it out! my favourite flavour is the yoghurt one because it tastes like yakult - they have a few different flavours but the collagen they use is the same across all the sachet products.",1

긍정,"I think Ratzilla is just translating what’s included in the Japanese marketing copy so if it’s not mentioned she won’t include it in the table.

Japanese sunscreens tend to value being cosmetically elegant above anything else so they aren’t usually the best for rigorous outdoor sports. The best sports one I’ve tried so far is Biore Athlizm but I just wear it to the gym. I’d still rely on a proper sports oriented one that’s rated for water resistance if I ever want to spend extended amount of time outdoors and will be swimming or sweating a lot.

If I’m wearing makeup and spending some time  outdoors (eg: wedding, hanging out with friends at a cafe patio) I use Anessa. It really works so well under makeup 🥲",5

I sleep with a long silk bonnet and it does a great job of preserving the curl pattern.

I find that the care in the first week matters the most. After that, the curl is basically set - it may get gradually looser over time, but the wave shape is set, if that makes any sense. So in the first week I really baby my hair: go as long as possible without shampooing, and when I do shampoo, be very gentle to try not to disrupt the curls; use a long bonnet and try not to toss and turn too much.",3

긍정,"Just a thought: When I first started using AB, my skin seemed sensitive to so many ingredients—niacinamide, willow bark, HYA, etc. But once the good people on this sub got me started on fixing my barrier, I was able to tolerate more ingredients. Sometimes the reaction is a sign of a compromised barrier. 

Also, it really depends a lot on the products you are using. If you are using products with lots of active and functional ingredients or botanicals or essential oils, the problem could be that. Tiny whiteheads on the cheeks and temples sounds like a reaction to a fragrant ingredient. Butylene glycol is ubiquitous, so you may conclude it is the culprit. But it could very well be something else. Essential oils and fragrances cause tiny whiteheads, and so can epidermal growth factors. 

I’d be interested in seeing your routine/ products. It just may not be the butylene glycol.",8

Many brands use formulations that are identical to those used in the West. Many Western brands copy Korean skincare. In the vast world of Korean skincare, there can be found products that don’t break you out.",1
긍정,Oh good!,3
중립,Share that list because it’s not popping up on the search 😭,1
긍정,"I am also Canadian and ever since Trump keeps messing with the tariff situation here, I've chosen to mainly stick to Canadian products as well out of solidarity to my own country.

I do like using:
- Mediheal pads
- Haru Haru black rice toner

And I only use Korean or Japanese facial sunscreens. Those are by far the most superior and much cheaper. I'll never give up my Asian sunscreens. 

One of my closest friends used to work in the skincare industry and was actually one of the first beauty bloggers to discover Beauty of Joseon and write about it. We have many discussions about skincare products. I have been given a giant bag of samples of skincare products from another friend and tried many, many brands - Asian and Western. My friends and I have a group chat for skincare and we're constantly sharing information on things we're trying. 

However, being Canadian sometimes the effort to get Korean products is too much of a hassle for the possibility the product breaks me out. It's time consuming to check ingredients and also take a risk on things that won't work. 

So I'm not gonna bother when now in 2025, I also prefer to use products from small Canadian businesses who do a lot of great research into developing some amazing products to support my fellow countrymen.",2
긍정,"If you want to support your own country by buying Canadian, fine. But the level of nuance displayed in your response exceeds the statement that you “can’t use a lot of Korean products.” The Korean skincare industry is not only massive but also influential and leads the way in skincare innovations, which your “fellow countrymen” benefit from in many ways. You absolutely *could* use a lot of Korean skincare products because a great many differ very little from products from in Canada. But you choose not to do so for certain practical reasons. 

Your nationalistic fervor seems rather tone deaf on a subreddit dedicated to Asian beauty. And because your last paragraph subtly implies that research is a key element in Canadian skincare, I want to underscore that Korean beauty products are also grounded in research and scientific studies, which are often overlooked by western-centric scholars—until they are needed to justify duplicating korean formulations in western nations.

I am trying to imagine going over to the Canadian skincare subreddit and saying “I can’t use a lot of Canadian skincare because it breaks me out,” and I cannot. It seems both provocative and dismissive.",1

If I wear makeup then I remove with an oil cleanser and remove with a warm washcloth and start my skincare routine or hop in the shower and double cleanse then start my skincare routine. Shower days I cleanse face and do skincare like normal. For body I have several- Hempz, Eos, Palmer’s, Nivea Cocoa butter, Aveeno Stress relief. When I am REALLY dry I pull out the Nivea cream ( German formula) or even better, the Palmer’s Coconut solid (or Cocoa butter solid, but I have started to find that the coconut solid is even more long lasting for me, personally).

To me, it’s about layering humectants early in the routine, adding ferments, and sealing them in with a moisturizer. My skincare routine sort of builds up to a glow. A mist over everything can add more glow. I also think vitamin c helps. Doesn’t have to be l-ascorbic acid either. Isntree HYA essence serum has a vitamin c derivative that makes my skin glow.",48

긍정,"I’ve used separate eye creams on the past but I don’t anymore.

Overall my collagen is still good and I have super thick skin with plenty of subcutaneous fat so there’s plenty of padding from underneath and my skin isn’t particularly saggy or loose.

I also think have oily skin and oily-as-heck eyelids helps with the non-wrinkling.

These days I just dab extra moisturizer under the eye. My eyebrows also tend to get a bit dry in the winter so I’ll apply moisturizer around the bone.

Overall it’s my cheeks that tend to get dry so if I slather anything on (sometimes I mix moisturizers to accommodate for my combo t-zone) I just bring it up all the way to my bottom eyelid.  Generally for the eye area because of my oiliness I prefer serums and lighter moisturizers, layered, not thick occlusives, especially at night.

Serums and essences and toners have been my fav thing since diving into AB and KB.",1

긍정,"I first want to start my review by saying that I feel like some of these blushes were unnecessary/not-worth purchases. Mainly the Dior and Clinique blush. I also listed a decent amount of Western blushes because I have either seen a lot of Korean MUAs/makeup shops carry them, or because I think the shade would be very popular if sold in Korea.

I've seen a lot of complaints about the Dior blush having 0 pigment, but I think it's due to consumers trying to swatch in-store using their finger. It did take a lot of digging in my pan to produce this finger swatch, but a low-density brush picks up the pigment 100x better. That said, I feel like this blush got duped by 10 other brands and there's just way better formulations for a similar pricepoint, like Gucci, Armani, YSL, or Patrick Ta. It's not blurring at all like the other blushes in the list, it's just a wash of color that doesn't do much for my complexion and it's almost too dark for a blue-pink, at least for my liking.

I love the Clinique blush, but it's not worth the pain in the ass it takes to get it shipped from Korea at a markup. The color is super pretty, but damn is it hard to build up any noticeable pigment. It has very subtle pearls in the formula, which the other powder blushes in this post do not. It adds a slight shininess to the cheeks without it looking like glitter. I've been using it for about a year now and hit pan, but also, I've been using it very sparingly because I just really hate having things shipped from overseas. Plus, I feel like the two shades above it (Rom&nd and Dasique) are lowkey dupes for it when applied to the cheeks. Also, while I didn't swatch them today, I have the Melon & Pansy pop shades. If anyone is curious, I will answer in a further comment but this review is already long enough on it's own.

I have conflicting thoughts about both of the Rom&nd blushes. The ""deeper"" one (it's not deep at all), Blueberry Chip, is the perfect daily shade for me--it's a perfect mute/neutral pink that doesn't look like skin irritation--and I don't need to use much of it. I see a lot of Korean MUAs/YouTubers use the Strawberry one as a ""blush base"" and while I do notice a slight improvement in blending and saturation when doing that, the blush is SO POWDERY that it's just annoying to use. It flies everywhere. And while it blends very smoothly, I hate the fallout and mess it makes in the pan if you're rushing in the mornings like I am. If I had to describe the texture of this blush, it'd be like flour or powdered sugar--very fluffy.

The Dasique blushes feel like ""watered down"" versions of the Rom&nd blushes. Less pigmentation, but also less fallout. It feels more chalky than it does powdery. I need to build it up a lot with the brush. But I do find myself reaching for the coral shade a lot as it's very fluorescent and makes my blush stand out (without looking garish/clown-y). It's a good product for the price, and as a very pale person I'm not concerned with the lack of pigment that those with deeper skin tones might find an issue with.

Finally, the Patrick Ta blushes have to be my current favorite. No fallout and very buildable. I am yet to try the ""cream-over-powder"" technique that Patrick Ta recommends because that has not consistently worked for my other cream blushes including Dior and Armani; it's a hit-or-miss technique. I noticed for the ""She's That Girl"" shade, however, the cream is very obviously cool-leaning while the powder is extremely warm so I kinda feel like I threw half of my money away--but I like the formulation and color of the cream so much that I'm fine with that. It also reminds me of AOU's blush in the Peony shade, but that's just me imagining things--if someone has it, feel free to comment a picture of it lol. I like the ""Just Enough"" duo for super cool-toned makeup looks, where I might even pop on a little bit of my purple Clinique blush.

I hope this post helps at least one person. Let me know if you have any questions and I'm happy to answer!",8
중립,WOWOW!! Patrick ones are niceee and pigmented,2
중립,"Which Rom&nd blusher did you hit pan on? Is it Strawberry Milk? Does it show up on your cheeks at all? Because from the swatches, it literally looks like it matches your skin tone like a foundation. 😆",1
긍정,"i need to know what you think of melon and pansy pop 

i'm a hugeeeeee fan of clinique blushes and i've decided to only purchase clinique blushes from now on. i have plum, fig, and cola but i'm thinking of something more pale and want to look into melon or pansy if it's cool tone

the last blush i purchased was visee foggy cheeks which is very easy to pick up and quite pigmented for jbeauty. i love it as a close second but my heart is with clinique",1
중립,"Yeah, I had to dig into them the least when producing swatches. The Korean blushes, while I like using daily, were very hard to make an even swatch that showed the pigment",2
중립,"LOL yeah, it's pigmented but it's so similar in brightness to my skin. Strawberry milk is the one I hit pan on, yes. For me, when I put it on, it just looks like I used a pink filter on my skin if that makes sense? There's no difference in shade, literally just a cool pink hue. The image in cool lighting shows the effect better",1
중립,"Pansy pop is the like the Dasique Bubble Coral but a little deeper and way more saturated. I use bubble coral if I don't want a heavy cheek, and melon pop if I need a pop of color. If you use plum, fig, and cola, then melon pop will definitely be the pale shade you're looking for. But it's more neutral or spring.

For cool tone, I recommend heather or pink pop as I've swatched them in store before. Pansy pop is PURPLE-PURPLE. I see most Korean MUAs/influencers using it like a ""blush topper"" to shift the tone of any blush they already applied, or very lightly and sheered out to create a wash of super cool-toned pink. If you're pale, this blush will definitely last a long time as a little goes a long way",1

긍정,"Hi! I’m looking for suitable blush/lip shades for me. I believe I have **light medium, warm leaning olive skin**, but I attached two photos of me in different lightings so you can see my exact skin/lip tone.

https://preview.redd.it/xkd6qzilvpyf1.jpeg?width=3972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=113842cc80be66f72248c41df367b561cb0f29d9

Here’s **my experience with the blush shades** I have:

1. Judydoll glow blush balm: shade 04 spring breeze - my favorite so far, I prefer nude, warm shades, tho it might be a bit “orange”/not peachy-rosy enough for my liking.
2. Canmake cream cheek: shade 16 Almond Terracotta - I think it suits me…but in some lightings makes my olive skin look more olive/yellowish-green 😭
3. Judydoll Gradient Blush: shade 02 Peach Cloud - I think this one suits me the best if it weren’t so light. It’s also the most similar to my natural blush color, which is soft, neutral—>warm (?) pink
4. Red Chamber Haruki Blush: shade Monsia - way too *ashy*, makes me look kinda bruised and “vampire” like.
5. Canmake Glow Fleur Cheeks: shade Milky Red - pretty suitable for me, but I prefer but less red and more nude/not as vibrant.

**Some lip shades I have:**

* Rom&nd Glasting Color gloss:

1. Rose Finch - slightly too pink and “colorful” against my skin for my liking.
2. Deepen Moor - I love it. However it doesn’t match my ideal blush shade and can come off as too deep/darkly colored.
3. Joocyee Glazed Rouge: shade Frozen Black Tea - too bright, a pop of reddish coral color for me. The advertised color would’ve been a lot better imo.
4. Nude reju lip gloss: Shade Apple Blended - I love this color when I wear it with my black hoodie, but it can sometimes be too red in a slightly vibrant way.
5. Judydoll Ice Cool lip essence lip glaze: shade Earl Grey ice - Why. Just why?? The advertised color was near perfection (perhaps but warm) for me but it pulled sooooo orange and bit brownish. Least favorite shade.

Anyway, my **ideal** lip color is one that’s as close to my **natural lip color** as possible and lines up the best with my **skin tone**. My ideal blush color would also go really well with my skin tone and be close to my natural blush color (**peachy, slightly dusty, neutral soft pink**).

The main struggle I’m having is **finding lip and blush shades that meet my respective requirements while being similar to/complementing one another.**

Thank you for reading, please comment all your shade pairing recommendations!

If you have any suggestions for a moisturizing **matte/satin/not glossy finish lip product** that doesn’t separate into lip lines, please lmk too! Thanks :) 🙏",2

I also stick to my more moisturizing sunscreens like cosrx aloe sun cream when it's cooler.",1
중립,"cold weather = moving from my dokdo cleanser to the isntree yam root cleanser. I live in the uk so the air is quite bitingly cold and dry. Just swapping out my cleanser works because the rest of my routine is Iunik's beta glucan serum, illyoon cream and sunscreen.",1
중립,"my skin type is dehydrated-oily, and I do swap some stuff.

I add an extra layer of lotion-type essence after my usual toner/essence. I swap my HA serums to thicker ones like the Decorte liposome. I add a more occlusive type of cream with ceramides to my daily lightweight cream moisturiser to prevent water loss. I use less actives as my skin surface will get really dry, and I bring around a travel sized bi-phase for the day.",1

중립,"Hi, which heavier cream do you use in winters?",1
중립,"Yep. In 45C 80% Relative Humidity I’ll use 1/2 a pea size of Aestura cream in the AM, on a damp face, over a couple of drops of hydrating toner/serum. That’s more than enough. In the 0C 15-20% RH, 1.5 - 2 pea size, over 3-4 drops of humectant. It’s the same thing, and does what I need it to, but I can still have that single product stretch across seasons. Nothing unpredictable happens, it just takes a little trial and error.",1

긍정,"I enjoy trying new products, and haven't found an hg cream for pm yet (in the morning I use the Round Lab Dokdo lotion as a final step before sunscreen). I think the Illiyoon cream is probably the thickest I've tried and will be good for really cold days, but I currently only use it when I'm feeling extra dry or sensitive. The Soon Jung 2x Barrier cream was ok for me, but not my favorite (it's on the thinner side). Last winter I tried the Round Lab Soybean cream and a non-ab cream (Biossance squalane), which were nice, but I didn't love them and won't be repurchasing; I found them both a bit greasy feeling. I actually really liked the Mary&May blackberry cream and might go back to that after the ones I have lined up to try this winter, if I don't like them better. The Abib barrier jelly has honestly been fantastic for me in dry central air, so I think the combo of that with the Mary&May cream might be perfect. But I've got a couple Stylevana freebies to get through first (Haruharu peptide cream and Skin1004 probio cica cream)!",1

Hello Asian Beauty community!! In lieu of nearly finishing this Flower Knows lipstick (my favourite c beauty brand for their packaging and general aura), I thought it was time to make a review regarding the first product of theirs I've come this close to finishing.

긍정,"i reacted to most of the sunscreens i've used. either it gets into my eyes after some time and make them burn, i break out, my skin burns when i apply the sunscreen or my skin starts itching. rationally, i know how important sunscreen is but that's the reason i often forego this step.

i recently realised i'm allergic to 1,2-hexanediol which is basically in every korean product nowadays. my skin is especially reactive when 1,2-hexanediol is in watery porudcts, there are some creams and thicker serums/toner i have been using for a while and that contain 1,2-hexanediol. i've never had issues with those. this is good for my wallet because i can't try out as much but also kind of sad because i also have a bunch of other allergies so there really isn't a lot of skincare left that i can use.",29

Irrational reason: I won’t use makeup products that have two shades mixed in one component such as marbled eyeshadows or those swirled lip glosses. Simply because I don’t like two different things touching and feel like I won’t get the same result every time. Also don’t like my foods to touch so probably related to that.",30

긍정,"I **BURNED** my under eye with micellar water from Bioderma and it's still slightly visible after two years. 


How did it happen? Well Bioderma micellar water was recommended to me by everyone, and it seemed like a nice thing for those days that I am too sick to cleanse my face properly (I was in a dire medical situation at the time) since everyone said it doesn't have to be rinsed off. So one day I tried it, removed what was left of my eye makeup and put an occlusive cream over my face. **THEN IT STARTED BURNING LIKE HELL!!!** I sprinted to my bathroom and washed my face with water.


When I inspected the eye area that burned I saw a burn 1cm*1cm on my under eye area with spots that were brown (some are still brown after two years but much less noticeable maybe because of retinal).



I don't know what I did wrong but the fact that that could happen makes me not want to purchase such products ever again, since I am kinda traumatised. It was a real product as well, bought from a city pharmacy.",6

Big shocker since I bought it to fix my barrier. 

Big shocker overall about the trapping too much hydration too, which in retrospect, I’ve experienced a few times, once when I mixed too much pure glycerin with my moisturizer then slugged it. So no allergic dermatitis, necessarily! At least I’m personally educated in wrecking your barrier doing too little and too much! Now I’m wary of too much of that glazed donut feeling. At some point I lost touch and forgot my skin was still supposed to feel like skin, albeit nicer skin.",3
중립,I just discovered that Yehwadam Heaven Grade Ginseng Rejuvenating eye cream and Numbuzin No 1 sunscreen don’t play well together. Together they sting the area around my eyes. Thankfully I always have a supply of Pyunkang Yul Calming barriers products on hand for these situations.,2

중립,Did you ever find a sunscreen that works for you without this ingredient you’re allergic to?,3
중립,"I think I have an issue with this or butylene glycol. And not always. Just have often experienced products with these ingredients not fully drying/leaving this film feeling and then my face eventually gets irritated from too much dampness so I don’t know that it’s necessarily an allergy/sensitivity or the mechanism. Because I’ve had the same experience mixing too much glycerin in my moisturizer before too, then slugging over it with oil. And I’m fine with all of that in reasonable amounts. The over hydration irritation I get is this redness, itchiness, and tiny pustules that do not look like acne. And it always takes a few days of subjecting it to the glazed donut treatment before it starts creeping up, first with the mildest itch. 

Have had this with Korean sunscreens and also ampoules/serums (wrote about it happening with Iunik beta glucan elsewhere in this thread). No problems with my beloved Zeroid moisturizers though 1,2-hexanediol is not as high in the ingredients there. Maybe it’s also about how one usually uses less moisturizer vs other skincare products. Especially with sunscreen you have to use a lot and you’re essentially slugging in every product you have on underneath.",2

중립,"There wasn't any difference at all! And based on the recs i saw on xiaohongshu, some other popular lenses in taiwan were pegavision, revia (a Japanese brand) and jhaka. I'd say that since taiwan manufactures a lot of Japanese lenses it was really easy to find lenses that were suitable for dry, sensitive eyes in their drugstores! But since it's not very accessible internationally the acuvue define lenses are also very comfortable.

중립,hi! wondering whats the texture of kisocare azelaic 20% like? im currently using skinoren but i feel that it's a little bit greasy,1
중립,Yes! Asian Beauty items are reformulated very often as well as being flat out discontinued . Thanks for understanding lol. The solidarity is tea.,3
중립,Which one do you like better Kisocare or Cos De Baha?,4
중립,very interested in your reviews of both,2
중립,What’s your favorite PDRN serum? Do you have any reccs? I’m looking to try one (but there are so many to choose from T-T),2
중립,"The essence sounds promising, thanks!",1
긍정,"It’s a cream, but definitely not greasy. And it comes out thin which is nice if you’re spot treating.",1
긍정,"It’s so hard to pick! I have so many PDRN serums and many that I haven’t even opened yet. I’ve been trying to finish the Medicube pink serum (I have the salmon pdrn version) and it’s so nice! It has a bunch of peptides including copper peptide. The only thing I feel iffy that disodium edta (it’s above the pdrn which is added at 1%) is so up on the list so I’m not going to use the other bottles I have once I finish this one. 
I’m really excited to use the Kisocare Milt PDRN serum which has 12% of salmon pdrn! 

I don’t recommend the VT pdrn essence cuz they say it has a high percentage of pdrn complex but the actual pdrn is extremely low. 

I also really enjoy the heveblue ampoule, it has pdrn + salmon egg extract!",2
중립,thanks! did u experience any reaction or purging when u used it?,1

긍정,Thank you!,1
긍정,"I think they're great for lazy mornings and for people who struggle with having any kind of skincare routine, looking for a one-step product. But cleansers are more economical and thorough imo. I will never stop recommending the isntree yam root milk cleanser for anyone looking for something very gentle ",9
중립,I have combo skin and during the winter my skin is prone to be more dry around the t-zone area. I don’t feel like I need to cleanse with soap in the mornings (unless I feel like it. I use cleansing water instead. I use the one from Torriden. It cleanses well and leaves my skin feeling hydrated from the HA in it. They also have it as a pad too!,3
중립,"I do this frequently when my skin doesn’t feel super oily in the mornings (like fall, winter). I typically DIY my own with my toner and a cotton pad and have never had problems with this causing breakouts. I just go with what my skin tells me it needs that day.",5
중립,"actually people are not replacing anything, they are just not cleasing at AM anymore, even dermatologists reccomend it.",7
긍정,"When I have toner pads, I do this. My skin is pretty dry and cleansing it in the morning every day would wreck havoc on my barrier. Additionally, I've lived in places where the water is really not good so using the toner pads to wipe off any sweat is a much safer bet. Tbh I think it's the same as rinsing your face with only water in the morning - it's just meant to get sweat from sleep off, which is only  what a lot of dry skin people like me need. ",2
중립,"Personally I wouldn’t do this, because I just wouldn’t feel like my skin is clean if I skip the actual cleansing step. But then again, I use exclusively balms for cleansing, so I have no concerns of dryness or messing up my barrier, which is why people might be doing this (unless they’re just being lazy, haha, which is valid!)",1
중립,"I use the Celimax One Step Mild Cleansing Pads to remove my makeup at night and sometimes instead of cleansing in the morning, they’re so hydrating and never sting my skin even after exfoliating with AHA/BHA/adapalene",1
중립,"I’ve been using kbeauty for like a decade now, I’ve tried the whole not cleansing my face in the morning because of this subreddit but it’s just not for me haha Like I tried just toner, just micellar water, rinsing off, my skin wasn’t a fan",1
중립,"I don’t cleanse at all in the morning. I just rinse with water and do my skincare. 

I do however, do a thorough cleanse at night.",1
중립,I have heard of this. And no I would not do it. I believe in doing a morning cleanse with a gentle cleanser. I think people are trying to find a thousand ways to avoid morning cleansings instead of just trying mild cleansers.,1
긍정,i'm in need of a gentle cleanser so i'll be adding this to my black friday list! thank you for the rec!,2
중립,Is the Isntree Yam root milk cleanser a 1st or 2nd step ? Or do you use it alone ?,1
긍정,Oh my god I have this in my Black Friday cart! It's so great to hear from someone that's used it!!,2
중립,This.,1
중립,"Well, no, not in the cases I’ve seen because she (and he) said “this is what I use for my morning cleanser” and then used another toner or two after. I’m sure that’s case in plenty of situations but the people I’ve seen doing this all say it’s their way of cleansing/washing. It’s mostly with an exfoliant. I have in the past just rinsed and went on my merry way with steps though!",1
긍정,Oh and gentle cleanser recs- Make Prem Safe Me line is super good.,1
중립,Can I ask you something about kbeauty since you’re experienced? Do all your products have niacinamide?,1
중립,I use it as a second cleanser. It's definitely not enough as a first step to take makeup and sunscreen off,2
중립,It won't disappoint!,2
중립,Dont get too hung up on the wording they are using. Using an exfoliating pad isn’t “cleansing”. They skipped cleansing and went straight to exfoliating no matter what words they use. I personally just rinse with water in the morning and carry on with the rest of my skincare routine,5
중립,Nope,1
중립,"Then it's a solid option for me for winter ! I don't wear make-up, and go without sunscreen most of the time in winter. I know it's blasphemy lol, but I work 12h shifts and don't see the sun all day in my work days as it's down before/after work here in winter. I also don't use harsh actives in my routine, it's mostly hydration and barrier consolidation oriented. 

I currently use the Skin1004 cleansing oil and ampoule foam and this has greatly improved my acne-prone skin, but I might give the Yam root milk cleanser a try as my combo skin tends to be dehydrated and tight in winter...",2
중립,[deleted],51
부정,"I feel you. 

I'm also in Europe, and two of my orders were charged customs fees. Yesstyle refunds it in the form of credit, which is just so frustrating because that's not REALLY a refund. It obviously causes us to buy more.

On one of their sales, they marked some items I wanted as in stock -- turns out, they were never in stock, they were actually completely discontinued by the manufacturer. But I'd added other items to get free shipping, and they wouldn't let me cancel them. What a waste of packaging and fuel. I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't an accident.

And then all the delays too, like yours.

I've used up my refund credit now, and going to stick to other sites because I'm so pissed at their business practices. Stylevana is often cheaper. Also Notino and Makeup",98
중립,I never have this problem with yeststyle but with Stylevana . Ordered from them last week of August and finally my order arrived this week. Also always try to order stuff that is in stock to be posted in 24 hrs. Had to go to boots to restock spf in the meantime,46
부정,"Crap. One of my orders says it was shipped on the 18th, but I've had no tracking updates since then (says ""Shipping label created, USPS awaiting item""), so I emailed them last night, and am yet to receive a response. How frustrating!

Edit: Am in the US.",9
긍정,"If you're in the UK, skinsider is great. Interestingly, iherb is extremely fast too and reasonably priced.",8
중립,It's so weird bc this has happened to me twice now ordering from Europe. When I lived in Canada and the US I never had this issue with Yesstyle. Maybe an EU thing?,26
긍정,"It is seriously worth it to order from Olive Young for anything you need and you don’t have a back up

I keep my eyes open for their sales and coupons, which tend to be good. They also do a lot of 1+1s or other bonus items",19
중립,"I ordered from the EU as well, I had a few of those products that take 3 weeks to ship and it did take exactly 3 weeks but after that it arrived in less than a week, I guess it depends on the situation.",8
부정,They had my package delivered by a really shitty carrier (Apple Express) who delivered to a completely different address with photographic proof that its the wrong address. They’ve basically told me I’m shit out of luck because it says it’s been delivered and the carrier ghosted me and won’t do anything either. I would hate to do a chargeback on my credit card because I know I won’t be able to order from there ever again but it’s so ridiculous to deny me a refund when the proof of delivery is very clearly not my house.,2
중립,"I’m sorry — I was just about to place an order with them because Stylevana doesn’t have the products I’m looking for, and their prices seem lower. Now I’m having second thoughts about ordering since I know they’ve had issues with deliveries, which is why I was thinking of making a small, low-cost order — one that I wouldn’t regret if it never arrived.",3
중립,"I ordered from yesstyle and stylevana at the same time and the yesstyle package has yet to move and the stylevana one is almost here. Despite seeing more of yesstyle on my particular algorithm, and occasionally ordering, I keep having a better time elsewhere",2
긍정,"I literally just had a bad experience with them, too! I was wondering if anyone's experience had changed recently! I was only on my second order with them. 

My situation: items that said they'd be with them in 7-14 days weren't there after 14 days. I then had to contact them to discuss it even though not getting something within an advertised timeframe is obviously an issue on the sellers end. They then said I could keep waiting (but that they had no idea when they'd get those products) or refund the non-supplied items and ship the rest. I left extra days, just to see if they'd end up eventually getting the things. They didn't, and I then sent an email on October 29, asking whether, instead of what they suggested, I could just substitute/add other products I wanted that cost more, obviously at my additional cost. Given what a saga it was turning out to be, when they didn't reply promptly to the email, I ended up contacting them again through the chat feature to get that clarification, feeling like enough time had already been wasted (the answer was no!) I then opted that day to just have the rest shipped. They then sat on the order for several days after that, which I thought was kind of wild after everything else! Ultimately, I put in the order on October 11 and it was only shipped yesterday.

I didn't really have issues with the other order I made before this, but couldn't believe how convoluted this became. Because it took so long, I ended up having to locally buy another serum and lotion at our wack Australian prices because I'd been waiting so long for the stuff in the order to get to me that I was running low on what I use, and genuinely had no idea when I'd ever see the Yesstyle products because of how annoying this whole timeline was. I also so agree about the annoyance of getting their marketing emails while going ""Yeah, okay...but where's the stuff I already ordered, damn it?!"" I also think it's not good policy for unsupplied product refunds to be automatically given as store credit and only provided as a genuine refund if a customer takes an extra step, when this is specifically happening in the context of a business not supplying items it said it could. Like, I didn't change my mind about the products. The shop changed its ability to supply items. Why do customers then need to opt-in to a bona fide refund that potentially takes 30 days? 

I know it's skin products and I don't have some emergency need for them, but some of this just isn't good business practice and I don't feel like it's that hard to realise that this would be annoying to customers. Maybe the business just has so much money and so many customers that they don't really care about bothering some, though - especially due to how competitive their prices are and how massive the range is.",2
중립,"This is why i’m still hesitant in hitting that place order button in yesstyle.
Patience is not my virtue, and if I ever experience that “credit refund” thing, i’d lose it for being screwed over-twice.",2
중립,I've ordered from YS and Stylevna multiple times and no issues.,3
중립,I have the same problem and I am in Europe. So frustrating.,2
중립,"Im in Australia, dont have any issues.",2
중립,"I’m from Eastern Europe and I’ve never had issues with Yesstyle, been ordering since 2019 every 2-3 months. Got hit by customs once in 2020 but they refunded it fully. Never got hit by customs again. Order always arrives on time - by DPD within 2-3 weeks. But reading this makes me a bit worried…",1
중립,They forgot one of my products and it was hell to get it back 😭 They gave me the wrong tracking number and all,1
긍정,"How strange, so sorry that happened to you. Personally I always had a good experience with them but, I do the opposite of you, which is I always AVOID the products that ""ship within 21 days"" because it takes so long and sometimes they can be actually out of stock (happened to me once). So except if I really want one of those items, they are the ones I usually avoid.",1
중립,Well we are having a same experience. I have been waiting for it for 2months and contacted their live agents and email nothing was helpful. They didn’t tell me the truth and I requested to get a refund and they refused. I ordered $250 worth products and still have no refund or products. I will never ever order products from Yesstyle again.,1
중립,Why not order from olive young? I did YesStyle twice never again. The shipping and waiting isn’t worth it,1
중립,Probably an EU thing! I’m in Canada and made 2 orders recently- one arrived in 2 weeks and the other in 9 days.,1
중립,"So I’m in the US, and I ordered something 5 weeks ago and it still has yet to arrive! Very pissed off, and will not be ordering from them again either…",1
중립,"This would imply that the customer data bank of yesstyle had been leaked, which isn't the case. Otherwise, more people would.complain. your credit card info was probably attained by hacking into accounts of yours. Do you use the same e-mail address and password on different websites? Have you checked if your e-mail has been compromised ?https://haveibeenpwned.com/",3
중립,"I'm in the US, but I will always use Stylevana! They don't charge tariffs and there are no brokerage fees when delivering to the US.",8
중립,"All of this. And the fact that they say things will be shipped within 24 hours, but at most they create the shipping label within that time fram (if even), and then it just sits there for days or weeks on end.",19
중립,"I hope you get your package soon! I also made an order on the 18th (I'm assuming this month, of  October?) and I just got my package yesterday  (live in Texas). Mine was shipped through Uniuni and there wasn't *any* updates for tracking until a couple days ago.",3
중립,I think it’s happening all around. I am in US and waiting for my package for 2 months still nothing.,1
중립,"I enjoy olive young more since their shipping is faster. They sell most if not all the K-beauty products I like using anyways. While yesstyle was cheaper, the trade off is their slow shipping unless you buy enough to get free express shipping.",5
중립,Just do a credit card charge back and then create a new account,1
부정,I have been waiting for my package for 2 months. Still have nothing delivered. I sent them email and connected to a live agents and I asked for refund since I haven’t received my package for 2months. The worst part is they did not even offer me credit refund! I think they are having problem for shipping since August.,1
긍정,I’m happy to read this. I’m Aussie too and shop there when I can’t find it here in Aus. But haven’t shopped on YesStyle for a year or more.,2
중립,"if op is european, buying from oliveyoung means paying basically guaranteed customs.",28
중립,Some of us use Japanese products.  Doubt they are available at Olive Young.,15
중립,"Olive Young is really expensive in my experience, especially if you're looking to try stuff out and can't take advantage of bulk discounts. And IIRC they ship DHL, at least to Canada, which practically guarantees duties with exorbitant processing fees.",14
부정,"Nah, just bad luck I think :( 

I have ordered from both stylevana and yesstyle (actually twice from latter one in last months due to sales) to Germany, which is notorious for finicky customs and had zero issues, stuff always arrived within 3 weeks or less.",4
부정,"My data has not been leaked. I came to the conclusion it maybe had something to do with how the payment is being transferred/routed in EU/Asia. The first charge was in Hong Kong and instantly after that in Estonia. In addition there was a third attempt at a charge, after which my bank flagged it and automatically cancelled my card and the payments. (Sorry for the confusing explanation, English is not my first or second language and I’m not sure if I’m using the correct terms.) Anyhow, I contacted Yesstyle instantly after this and they never got back to me, and this whole thing left a really bad taste in my mouth. There’s never been any issues like this with Stylevana. E: I’m really strict with data security and never reuse passwords, and I often check if my info has been compromised",1
중립,Omg! I JUST got an update that my package has finally reached the US! PHEW!,3
중립,Wouldn’t my credit card be flagged in their system?,1
부정,Ah sorry had no idea. Is it a lot? I used to pay around $15 for my orders which are usually between $200-250. I may be bad at conversion lol.,1
긍정,"Have you tried Amazon Japan? I’m in the US but did an Amazon JP haul over the summer and had a good experience. Products were much cheaper but shipping was more so it worked out to be about the same cost as Yes Style. They had some newer products I had never seen on YS plus I was able to get some other non-skin care stuff. I’m sure this varies by country, but for that US (at least in July) they included duties and tariffs at checkout and prepaid them.",5
긍정,"That’s the problem I have, my HG sunscreen is Skin Aqua, which is Japanese, and YesStyle always has it. But I’m in the U.S. so sometimes I order from senti senti dot com, which supports a minority-woman-owned small business in NYC, so I feel good about that. Prices are usually a little higher than YesStyle but they ship immediately, often the same day I place my order.",8
중립,"I wanna try Japanese skincare so bad but my experience with yes style wasn’t great so I’ll just make do with StyleKorean but now I see that it’s very expensive to deliver to some countries which I had no idea about.

Edit: olive young. Not StyleKorean. I used to use style Korean before I discovered olive young.",1
중립,"I can tell you it's very unlikely that the payment service provider has a security issue. Otherwise, other credit card customers would have been affected too. Someone got hold of your credit card info because you've used it either in a shop where employees have stolen your data, via social engineering, a compromised payment device or hacked into one of your shop accounts where you saved all your credit card info. 

It is very unlikely that yesstyle is the offender. 

I can only advise you to use a service that hides your credit card info, like paypal, install 2FA and be very vigilant on where you use your card. Get a cyber insurance that covers any possible damages, use strong passwords and e-mail alias",1
긍정,"That's great news for you! I'm based in the US also and this is my first time using YesStyle. I only ordered things that claimed to ship in 24 hours but my status hasn't changed from order received for two weeks now. I placed my order on October 20th. Same tracker/shipper as yours, so I'm hoping it's because they didn't update the info.",3
중립,Doubtful. If anything you're address/name/IP would be. But for a website that large I doubt they bother,1
중립,"the tax here is around 20%, plus customs handling fees. last time i ordered from oliveyoung the package was worth roughly 60 bucks and everything included i paid another 40 bucks in fees.",6
중립,"Sorry, I didn’t mean to imply that the payment service provider has a security issue, but that this was some kind of hiccup/delay in the way they normally process/route the payments and the strict security measures of my bank shut everything down. Yesstyle is mainly to blame for the abysmal customer service, but this whole thing made me not want to shop there. I wasn’t clear enough in my original comment, I’ll edit it. 

Thanks for your advice though, very helpful and important for everyone who makes purchases online. I have a new card already and do use PayPal.",1
중립,Fingers crossed for you!!!!,2
중립,"I’m in this same boat too! Ordered on Oct 24 and my USPS link says “ Shipping Label Created, USPS Awaiting Item” so hopefully it comes soon for all of us 🙏 ",1
긍정,Thank you for sharing! My skin is more tan and Nougat Sand is a great MLBB while Pomelo skin looked pale (the previous version). It's interesting to see how different stuff look on different people,2

중립,I wanted the mini eyeshadow palettes but unfortunately they come as a set with the full sized ones so no,2
중립,"I had the same experience with the pink foundation literally dissapearing and having no lasting power whatsoever so I'm not sure if its a you problem, I got the mini cushion and finished it completely and had the same results each time no matter what else I did so.....!

중립,Illiyoon ceramide cream,38
중립,"Skin type: VERY DRY

Weather: colder and drier currently

Review: Beauty of Joseon rice and probiotics sunscreen. This sunscreen is my holy grail because I've finally found one which moisturizes me enough. This glides on like butter and is so soft and smooth. This, however, is not water and sweat resistant so you might wanna reapply but other than that the texture is like whipped cream. One thing that I've noticed is that it also calms down the skin because the ingredients are barrier repairing as well. Redness calms down. For me, it definitely sinks in, very hydrating and moisturizimg, plus it gives that radiance and luminosity that is just chef's kiss. Reapplication is smooth too. It has no fragrance. I wish this sunscreen was a moisturizer, like same ingredients, same texture for my PM skincare routine. Not to sound dramatic but I can't imagine my life without it.",96

Hi! So i have acne prone skin (or had?? As i was on accutane and the acne completely went away, didnt have a single breakout since then) but i had some bumps which felt like just congestion deep inside my skin. I never used anything special for my skincare, just salicylic acid facewash and moisturizer + spf. My skin is on the drier+dehydrated side but my nose can get oily. It has been 2 years since i got done with accutane.

So i started using this serum around 3 weeks ago (nights) along with the centella tone brightening ampule (morning). My moisturizer & facewash are the same.  I started getting smallll breakouts (some are pus filled, some become whiteheads) around my mouth (the congestion usually was around my mouth. if i sort of stretched the skin u could see it, but in the daylight) since a couple of days ago. 

Could this be purging? Im kind of terrified because i had acne most of my life and accutane saved me. Im so scared of having it again ... i hope this IS purging and not acne making a comeback... i dont think there was this much congestion around my mouth??",1

Skin Type: Normally combo/normal but drier recently due to tretinoin use 

Country/Climate: UK Cold and Dry

Top Skin Concern: Patches of texture on my right cheek, faint fine line on forehead

Current Routine/Products I am Using:
Actives: Tretinoin Cream, Glycolic Acid, Vitamin C, Numbuzin Glow Toner Pads (contain PHA/LHA)
Hydrating/Soothing: Centella Hydrating Mist Spray, Centella Hyaluronic Acid
Barrier Support: Laneige Water Bank Moisturiser, Purito Barrier Cream

AM Routine: (The routine I'm currently following)
1.  Numbuzin Glow Toner Pads 
2.  Laneige Vitamin C 
3.  Centella Hyaluronic Acid
4.  Centella Hydrating Mist Spray
5.  Laneige Moisturiser 
6.  BOJ Sunscreen

PM Routine: (I am alternating actives with rest days to avoid irritation)

Tretinoin Nights (Mon/Fri): Cleanse > Tretinoin > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream
Glycolic Nights (Wed): Cleanse > Numbuzin Pads > Glycolic Acid > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream
Rest/Repair Nights: Cleanse > Centella Mist > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream 


I'm looking for feedback on whether the alternating PM routine is safe and effective for treating the texture while managing the dryness. I also am suspicious that the Purito cream may be making my face sting a little but am not sure if it’s due to the cream or overdoing my actives.

The issue with most tints is they're actually brighter than this shade (which I love) e.g. things like lilybryred Blackberry Tequila or 3CE ""Spiced Up"" in Lazy Pop Stain. I have a million plum vamps, and 332 K-Tints but we're not on speaking terms atm (Bright. Bright little girl colours I just can't).

Girlcult J808 and Dinto 216 ""Umbra"" are pretty much bang on to the Uhue U05 Like amazing close. Dinto you will need to layer to get the pigment.

Uhue MIrror Lipstick in G625. That's a more purple vamp than brown red, but it's a gorgeous vamp and it's still got that shine and sheerness if you want the comfort and a bit more ""soft goth""

Uhue Gloss in U06 is a similar tone, it's just much more sheer, a bit lighter and a bit less vamp and has glitter in it. That is actually still available through ""LookHealthyStore"". I've bought through them (Chinese) b4. Hyntoor's OG old Whimsical Planet Watery Lip Gloss in 002. Probably skip it tho, too sheer. Couldn't find it.

""Romantic Goth""? I'm old and goth goth, but I'm trying to think outside the box:

Pinate Bare Glow Peptide Melting Balm in ""Sequence"". It's similar to Uhue U06 it's sort of sheer plummy but with gorgeous glitter. It's ""classy sheer vamp"".  
Into You Glowing Lipstick in ML07 (Mauve) -  this is so classy and muted purple. It's romantic. I love it.  
Derol (YesStyle) Sugar Candy Glossy Balm ""Dominant"" is a deep vamp burgundy, Messy and all other shades are not nice but it's so cheap.  
Shellwe Makeup x Freya86 Punk Bunny Collection Gloss. It is beautiful. didn't swatch 'cos I knew it was a deep cool-tone but check it out. It's a lovely vamp and could be worn more sheer, too.  
Fenty Gloss Stix in ""Black'r Berry - she deep vamp tho, but you could sheer it out.  
Girlcult obvs. Sheered out, J809 and J816 might work in Lip Glaze, they're pretty deep though FYI, L06 Nightfeast (sheered out also) could look sort of ""classy goth"", but again that's a very deep brownish vamp like the others, I think the Mirror Glaze J7X's might be too gothy. J808 is a huge contender tho, just remember it tastes like roses.  
Rom&nd Deep Sangria JLT if you can still get it. It's not this but it's vampy/soft goth. Plum Coke if you don't mind a bit brighter. The black tint is back in the mini TJLT now (some of the mini Glasting Glosses are fun colours/colour changers)  
Heart Percent Dote On Mood Top Coating Lip Plumper in Mood Changer is a deep plum, so cool-toned, but could be handy to just mute and vamp down some of your existing collection.  
Don't overlook Revlon or L'Oreal on this.

More Goth Goth:

Hyntoor released some new shades recently, including a more trad red in their lip mud (B02 ""Carrie"") but not so close to this, it's more of a cool-tone or neutral-red, plus a black mirror gloss squeeeeeeee). Also look at their Dark Style Reverse Macaroon Lip Muds and the Subversive Series in their lip muds.  
Kaleidos lip muds, not shine, but they have several gorgeous brown red shades e.g. Cognac and Bloodstone, check out their other vamp reds like Rubino or Smeared Rouge, they're cooler-toned tho  
DRAMO Moonlight in the Bottle Lip Mud Series  
CARMELA Renaissance and Waste Soil Collection Lip Mud Series  
Girl's Crush (Red Thorn and Black Rivet are lovely)  
Parper Lab have some rad lip muds/liquid lips (black, white, vamp)  
Other than that it's Western indie for me so I'll leave it there.",30

긍정,"Hiya. Me again (sorry mods I didn't realise I couldn't give other Western recs in one post).

So, I've just been thinking today that you might be after that picture's colour (which is stunning) and not what the actual Uhue gloss looks like IRL, it does tend to come off deeper which is why Gircult J808 and Dinto 261 Umbra (I think I kept reversing my numbers on that) are decent matches. You could sheer it right out I guess but to get that nice shine I need to pile it on. 

So, I can't give you my Western rec I found but I was making room for my new Rom&nd releases and I thought I'd just show you these two from Rom&nd (3 technically but that was a play around). If you want a deeper vamp or brickish red, then Zero Velvets got you covered, but I think these, especially the gloss might be a vibe for you.

Rom&nd Glasting Gloss 18 Red Bean Sirutteok. It's a mini, it's not on YS or OY yet, it's on Beauty Box Korea and a few eBay sellers I use sometimes so that's a pain but it's gorge. You need to layer to get anything like Uhue pigment (and I think you'll still fall short) and it's a bit of a different finish, but I just feel like it's such an elegant soft of ""soft"" classy vamp-lite. Bit of red, bit of plum, bit of brown.

The second is good old Rom&nd Glasting Water Tint in 17 Woody Sunset. I feel like this is going to be a little too bright overall, though depends on your lip pigment, maybe a bit too like, brown as well...but I also wonder what mixing in some of the other reds would do. 

I swatched Milk Tea Velvet Tint 2 in ""Black Tea"" sheered right out (that's quite browny plum, but sheers out to more of a vamp plum, not on par with what you're after but it's pretty and I was just playing. Earl Grey nice too). The others at the back too bright.

I remember back when you had to pay a bollocks Royal Mail £8 “handling fee” on top of the 20% VAT of nearly every single minuscule order that was valued at over £30 (can’t recall the exact figure but something like that) from outside the EU. 

If we have to go back to this nonsense then I really hope they just take the tax out at checkout instead of holding your package ransom and then charging you almost a tenner to deliver it like they were supposed to in the first place and acting like they’re doing you a blood favour.

What companies will do is declare less value of each item you order, that’s what everyone does when shipping fashion SAMPLES 

Stylevana already does something weird where they don’t ship directly to you but to a 3rd party company in the UK that then ships to you, so you won’t get import fees yourself but they might raise the prices from the start?",14
중립,"Any goods valued £15+ can be charged 20% VAT. If it’s a gift then it’s £39.99+.

Then if the package is valued £135+ it is liable to VAT and Customs Duty, which varies depending on the type of goods in the package. 

As far as I know YesStyle prices include the VAT. I placed an order and it was below £135 so didn’t qualify for customs. But It states on YesStyle’s website that if we get charged fees they will reimburse us with credit. 
And when I contacted Stylevana for my first order they told me they’d reimburse me if I got any charges for the package. 

Ultimately, I’m not sure it’s going to change much from a business perspective. Perhaps slight price increases?",5

Yes. An import duty of *up to* 25%. There is the chance there could be a higher fee imposed on orders over 135 gbp to bring it in line.

>Just curious if anyone understands what this change would mean, will prices go up? Or is it more of a “wait and see” situation?

Prices won't necessarily go up at point of sale, you'll just have to account for paying DLD/Royal Mail before it can be delivered. I used to order from S Korea years ago and had to pay import duties at the sorting office before I could receive my delivery, although its probably all online now.

중립,The second one is sweat and humidity proof.,26
중립,"As per the website - 

Specifically designed for extreme climate conditions. Engineered to withstand high temperatures (40°C) and humidity (75%), this advanced sunscreen ensures long-lasting, durable protection against intense sun exposure.

Powered by Exclusive Tough Boost Technology, it provides friction resistance, maintaining its protective layer even with sweat, wiping, and clothing contact. Its very water-resistant formula offers up to 80 minutes of protection, making it ideal for outdoor activities.

Enriched with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, butylene glycol, and eucalyptus extract, it helps maintain skin moisture, preventing dryness caused by prolonged sun exposure. Additionally, it is non-comedogenic and dermatologically tested, making it suitable for daily wear.

UV Protection

Dang. Now I want to try it too 😂",13
중립,"I've actually always wondered the same thing but never made an effort to look into it lol so I also wanna know. 

BUT! I've used the normal version before and it's not very durable, meaning I sweat it off pretty easily since I live in a humid climate and I'm combo oily. I remember I actually got more tan while I was using this haha. It seems to work well for people who live in less humid/colder climates though! 

From the picture it looks like the extreme protection could be more sweat-proof. Dang, now I kinda wanna try the extreme version 😅",28
중립,"Someone tested the normal one in Australia, which has very high UV on a regular basis due to the thin ozone layer. Compared it against other sunscreens including popular (but thick and greasy asf) aussie ones. The normal biore came out on top. 
I've never seen the extreme before. But I use the normal one (also in Aus) and it has not failed me yet. Even 8+ hours after application with sweating and such from the day",3

중립,As someone who uses biore Athlizm version... Now I'm wondering what's the difference between this extreme one and the one that's meant for outdoor sports.,5
중립,"Idk i used the normal version in 37°C taiwanese summer and it worked fine on my pale, european, “the uv index is never above 6” skin 😅 yes i was also wearing a hat but i was still uncovered for some time (plus the UV index was 11+ most days)",5
중립,"If you have shopee, there’s an official kao shop there. That’s where I found it. Not sure where else it’s available other than Malaysia tho.",4
중립,if it means anything I live in Japan and I've never seen the extreme protection. But maybe I just didn't an eye out for it.,2
중립,"Ahh, I'm bummed cos I never got to try the Athlizm line. Now they don't sell it locally so the prices are so marked up. 😔 But you could totally be onto something here! Cos this is a translated screenshot from the Athlizm line promo:

It also mentions being able to withstand up to 40 degree Celsius and 75% humidity. 🤔 Interesting!",11
중립,"I'm glad it works for you! I've also seen comments in the past of people using this on the beach and not tanning/burning. I'm mindblown haha. 

Definitely not the case for me though. Now, do note that I last used this years ago so it's probably been reformulated many times already, but I could feel my face tingling within 1-2 hours of applying this sunscreen. And I was just running errands, not hiking up a mountain or lounging sexily by the pool or anything. I felt so betrayed I never tried the Biore essence ever again. 😭

... Until now I guess? I really wanna try the extreme protection version haha. And I really liked the Lotion version in this range!",0

긍정,"I can definitely recommend shiseido for their makeup! The revitalessence skin glow foundation and the synchro skin self refreshing foundation are wonderful foundations!

D program by Shiseido is my favorite skincare brand and it’s worked wonders for my skin. It’s mainly formulated for sensitive skin so there are no fragrances :)",50
긍정,"Certain products are worth it, to me, but I am an older woman (46) with a good amount of disposable income. I don't really have to budget/save up for skincare so I've tried a few mid to higher end products, both western and Asian brands.

Cons are they are usually fragranced, pros are more elegant formulations, advanced delivery systems and higher amounts of beneficial ingredients meaning they feel good on my skin, absorb better and deliver what they need to in a way that makes a difference to me.

Note that my routine isn't exclusively ""luxe"", I use them with more reasonably priced products. And just because they are luxe doesn't mean they would work better for everyone - case in point my favourite cleansing balm remains the BoJ cleansing balm. I prefer it to all others I have tried including Elemis (which was waxy and left a residue - ugh).

AB mid to luxury products that are staples in my routine:
- Sulwhasoo FCAS - for the glow. Works best paired with another first essence, used to be SK-II but I'm trying it out with Missha FTE to see if it works just as well.
- Sulwhasoo Ginseng cream, both classic and rich. My skin loves ginseng and this packs a punch - softening, smoothing, firming. I gave a sample of this to my 71 year old mum who was never into skincare and she now loves it as much as I do, I buy her a couple of tubs a year.
- SK-II cleansing oil - this alongside Fancl is my favourite. Skin feels so soft afterwards.
- su:m37 micro active powder wash - I use this a few times a week, particularly after makeup. Wonderful cleanser and I think a little bit exfoliating (which is why I can't use it too frequently)
- Whoo Bichup - great serum, skin softening and smoothing. I use this at night as it's too rich for my morning routine
- Sooryehan The Black Serum - same effects as Bichup but lighter consistency. The first time I used it I couldn't stop touching my face, it felt lovely and smooth.
- Amorepacific Vintage Single Extract Essence - a wonderful first essence. This one is in my evening routine, gives me a dose of antioxidants and also has a smoothing effect.",47
중립,[deleted],33
중립,"They're only worth it if it doesn't hurt to buy them. If you barely notice the extra, and you can still maintain a routine that suits you, splurge away.

If you would have to scrimp or sacrifice--no, not worth it. At that point, you're better off building a maximalist routine with less expensive products.",51
긍정,"For SKII, I love the facial treatment essence, skin power advanced cream, and sheet masks.

For Shiseido I love the eye cream.

For Cle de Peau, I love the UV protective cream. It’s super expensive as a sunscreen but it does triple duty for me as makeup primer and daytime moisturiser as well. I live in a humid climate though so if you’re somewhere dry this probably isn’t enough as a daytime moisturiser.",12
긍정,"They are if you can afford it! I personally love the SK-II Pitera Essence and don't really believe in 'dupes', especially when it comes to fermented ingredients. Of course, if you find a cheaper product works the same or better for you, then by all means. But I do think there is something to be said about the research, development, and experience of certain luxury products.",17
중립,"Sulwhasoo is definitely effective. It's just expensive, so I don't buy it often. If I had more money, I'd switch all my products to Sulwhasoo or Whoo. My mom gets this cosmetic gift once a year for the holidays, a set of skin care products, lotion, and serum.",8
중립,"SKII facial treatment essence is one of my HGs. I truly didn't know I needed this product until I did. I've tried dupes of this product, even more expensive ones on the market, but genuinely, nothing comes close to this. 

The price tag kills me, of course, HAHA, but I cannot get enough of the benefits. I especially notice how weird my skin gets when I don't use it, so there ya go!",8
긍정,"There are some amazing products that are absolutely worth the price tag, and there are flops, just like Western luxury brands. I *do* think that online discussions of Asian beauty focus too heavily on drugstore products, such as Hada Labo, Canmake, etc.,--this isn't a problem per se (it's great if those products work for you, especially in this economy), but it's like limiting yourself to brands like NYX and Wet n Wild in non-AB. Unfortunately, a lot of midrange/luxury AB products are not very accessible overseas, which means a lot of people don't discuss them because they are simply not aware of them.

  
Personally, I don't use Korean luxury brands because I don't vibe with their traditional aesthetics (my mum and grandma love them, though...), but I love Japanese department store brands. They have more interesting but still very wearable and stylish shades compared to drugstore brands when it comes to makeup products, plus some great foundations and primers. I also enjoy luxury skincare but do note that a lot (most?) of them contain fragrance. Some of my favorite brands are: Shu Uemura (their legendary cleansing oil), IPSA (toners), Cosme Decorte (sunscreen, liposome skincare line), Celvoke (their makeup line in general, cleansing oil, facial oil), Addiction Tokyo (makeup), THREE (makeup). I also recently got deluxe samples of Pola/BA's toners and cream, which are amazing. The weather's getting dry where I live, and they hydrate my skin perfectly. I want to get the full size products so badly, but the price makes me cry.",18
중립,"Is sekkisei considered luxury or midrange? Their packaging has a premium feel but distribution wise you can find them in 7-11 or next to sk-II counters in departments store. I think it was one of the few brands where I managed to complete a full size of lotion, but I always forget they exist.",4
긍정,"I don’t usually use luxury skincare. I’ve tried Sulwahsoo and none of their products really did anything for me. Their FCAS broke me out somehow.

I do adore SKII, though. The FTE and the masks. I swear they really help—I did masks each day for three days before my wedding and my face was glowing. I’ve tried the Missha dupe and it did improve my skin tone and evenness compared to using nothing, but it wasn’t quite as good.",5
중립,"Luxury skincare definitely isn't necessary because there are so many affordable brands, however there are some items that I think are worth the money.

As i've moved into my 30s i've started exploring luxury skincare and there are hits and misses of course. Lux products are usually formulated for an older demographic which has both its pros and cons. (Pros: cosmetic elegance, packaging, lots of R&D around products/ingredients, they don't discontinue products easily. Cons: heavily fragraced, products are heavier and can be worse for acne prone skin, don't follow skincare trends as closely)

I think if you have the disposable income, its fun to try some luxury products. I would recommend getting sample packs before buying anything full size, and also wait for sales. Sales on lux products can be a bit more rare, but i never pay full price for lux products!

Lux products worth the money to me:
- Sulwhasoo overnight vitalizing mask
- Sulwhasoo ginseng eye cream
- Sulwhasoo FCAS
- Donginbi ginseng daily defense setum
- Donginbi ginseng daily defense cream


             
Lux products not worth the money:
- SKII (did not work for my skin)
- Donginbi Ginseng Moisture & Firming Softener
- Biodance collagen masks (not technically lux but expensive)
- Sulwhasoo cleansing foam and oil",4
긍정,"I think the skincare is definitely worth looking into if you have dry skin, or at least normal/dehydrated skin. But also you need to be okay with fragrance and ferments. Oily/acne skin people will not have a good time.",3
중립,Clé de Peau for their foundations and my HG Brightening Serum Supreme. 🏅,3
긍정,"I’ve tried a lot of different low to high end Asian or western brands over the years and always wander back to Shiseido, it just sings to my skin like no other. 

I am a die hard ultimune serum fan. I’ve been using it since it came out in 2014 (minus 3 years between pregnancy and breastfeeding) and probably spend $4k+ on it over the years. It is worth every penny to me. I also LOVE their face wash, but have way too many gift with purchase facial cleanser to justify the $$. 😅",3
중립,I splurge on one luxury product and then live off drugstore everything else 😂 works for my wallet and my skin,3
중립,"For me, they are worth it now that I'm getting older. I swear by The History of Whoo and know their different lines quite well. I use different lines for the different seasons as they are quite extreme (I live in Switzerland; Summers are hot and the sun quite aggressive, winters are extremely dry and harsh, during spring and autumn the weather is all over the place...).
I had to try out new brands in my 30s, because my previous products slowly stopped doing their magic. 
The different lines of The Whoo cater to different skin needs and age ranges. The line for the young women is quite affordable I daresay.",3
중립,"Sk-ii FTE is my skin lifesaver. I don’t do skincare in teen and 20s, but I would use this on and off when i was younger whenever my skin got irritated or after i got sun burn and this soothes my skin like magic. Now as i’m doing skincare, i use this every day as my night routine and this is one product i would always buy and use",3
긍정,"Short answer is no. I don't think you need to buy ultra luxury to achieve the best skin you can have. I think a moderately priced lines are usually most cost effective. The increase in the benefit is not directly proportional with the increase in price. 

My take is buy what works for you and save the $$$ for cosmetic procedures. 

Long answer is it depends. 

If you are 30 something with decent skin, $575 Cle de Peau La Creme is not going to give you 10 times visible result than $40 Aestura cream. Your skin might look a little plumper, glowier but it's not going to be night and day. 

I have no problem buying expensive foundation if it gives me the coverage and finish I want. In my experience, the luxury brand tends to have foundation with better textures, less clogging, more color range and better packaging. As for  point makeup, I don't think my make up look that much different using $20 pallette vs $100+ pallette. 

For skincare, the uber expensive ones are lovely, feel more luxurious and smell a lot better, but they still don't erase fine lines or discoloration for me. 

Some expensive one, like SKII essence, gave me breakout. 

I now pick the skincare based on the actives- what I need. My routine is a mix of cheap, moderate, kinda pricey and prescription, but not super super expensive products.",5
긍정,"I do use a luxury priced brand but only purchase during sales/hot deals since the brand has that every month. I absolutely love their products especially the vita ampoule from Lavien but it’s crazy expensive rtp while they do deals with bundles and cost 40% cheaper or something..I also love Pink Wonder but it’s so pricey if you don’t purchase during a good sale. For korean brands, I tend to purchase directly from the brand or cjonstyle where there are sales going on or use a buy for me agent etc to forward to me.

I do think some of the pricier products are worth it but not all. I’ve tried a few vitamin c serums and Lavien is the only one that has worked for me.",2
긍정,"I like shiseido’s sunscreen in the white bottle where it adds abit of tone up  and sits well under my foundation base

Then I got their blue one shortly before their reformation. Tried both formulations for the blue one. I’m not a fan on how it sits under my foundation (Shu Uemura) so I just use concealer to cover my bags.

Compared to Anessa or Biore water gel grip and Suncut. I felt it’s way better as it doesn’t make my makeup look patchy/peeling like a lizards 


Shu Uemura (advanced) unlimited foundation

For context I live in a climate that’s hot and humid and I have combination skin (though it’s not as oily as when I was a teen)

I need a foundation that can last in a hot and humid climate.

I bought my first bottle in 2023 after getting swatched and asked for a sample to take home and tried it out. My then best friend said it looked very good after a long day of wearing it, so I got it after I considered my preferred options. The bottle lasted me over a year of wearing it

Got my second bottle in 2024 from cosme in Tokyo. Then they had the tsuya version of it and was contemplating getting it. Still stuck to the OG

Got my third bottle last week at their store in Daimaru, Sapporo (colder climate) after the reformulation (advanced). Had the same dilemma picking the matte one or the Tsuya one asked my sis to help me decide which looks better after getting swatched by the MUA. 

Stuck with the matte one considering I’m from a hot country

I haven’t tried it yet as I haven’t finished using my second bottle


Shu Uemura cleaning oil
Ngl one of the best cleansing oil. I’ve used 3 variations so far. The green, ultim8, black

Got my first full sized anti pollution (green) (450ml) at steal during warehouse sale where it’s like $150 usual price but I got it at $96. The bottle lasted me a year and a half.

I got ultim8 as a travel sized sample, works pretty good as well, makes my skin legit feel moisturized.

Currently I’m using the black one (pores), I say it’s alright just the texture of the oil is watery compared to the green and ultim8. No decrease in QOL so far

Also using their eyelash curler rn, goated for getting my lashes up but sometimes never curl everything and it’s hard to find pad replacements, stuck with the dupe pads. Saw their newer version of the eyelash curler named W which apparently more effective curling Asian lashes up.",2
긍정,"Shiseido Ultimune serum works well to keep my face hydrated. It doesn’t matter what cream I use afterwards. It just works very well. 

Cle de Peau foundation (when my skin feels dry) but when I travel I bring a tube of RMK foundation. 

RMK first sense hydrating lotion is an excellent lightweight hydrating lotion to use right after cleansing and before serum. RMK isn’t as expensive as other upscale Japanese brands but their skincare is great. I have used their hydrating oil and advance cream, which are great for dry skin. 

Sulwhasoo ginseng cream is fabulous. Just a tiny amount needed to keep the skin well moisturized. I bought two jars in Seoul duty free airport store bcs they were 30% less than in the city AND the sales staff threw in a generous kit of another Sulwhasoo brands line I can’t remember. One jar lasts 1.5 months.

I’m loving Lunasol right now. The eyeshadows, cream blush stick and lipstick are beautiful (color and texture). The prices are reasonable given their quality.",2
중립,"i have tried lot of cheaper brands- boj, eucerin, the ordinary, fleurance, puyuknag yul, i am from, cos de baha, missha, purito... the only ones that dont break me out (not acne but like rush) are the expensive ones. As in term of claims that creams lift and firm and make miracles, no cream does that. From shiseido i used eye serum Benefiance NutriPerfect that really removed under eye swelling and its discontinued",2
중립,depends what you want out of it. Most of the time you’re paying for the experience more than the formula. But Sulwhasoo’s ginseng line? That stuff actually feels worth it.,2
긍정,"imo any luxury brand is for people who can afford them and for people who want to feel like they can afford them. people can swear up and down that it's the best thing ever, changed their life, etc... it's up to you to decide if that is worth the price tag. to me, it is mostly just a status symbol and i don't find it to be worth it but i also don't make like, a ton of money, so I'm sure others will have a different opinion / experience. 

 i have tried a cream from la mer and a toner (?) from sk II and found it just fine. i have not tried a lot of luxury skincare products, i have tried some luxury beauty products, and somewhat related, my mom owns a lot of luxury handbags. i don't find them any of them to be worth the money. 

the beauty and wellness market is truly oversaturated these days, there are lots of options at different price points, there is something for everybody. something is worth it if you get value out of it.",2
중립,I suggest asking r/SkincareAddictionLux,1
긍정,"Just recently, I’ve been missing sk ii eye cream. Used that for at least two jars back then and it felt so good at plumping my under eyes and I swear it is the only eye cream I love till date! Their genoptic line was also nice, saw an immediate result with 1 bottle of consistent use. And omg, I also re-tested (like a sample tester kinda thing) for estee lauder night repair serum and I have been reminded of how much I used to love that (used a bottle or 2 in the past).

Honestly, I wouldn’t be able to tell how MUCH they worked ‘cause clearly, your girl didn’t have much disposable money then to keep using for years so I did not continue using them. But I’ll definitely pick any of these up with age picking up (and not that I have more coins now per se ya know?). 😝🫣",1

So for me, thats where I start. My skin needed tret for acne. Which meant that it needed way more hydration bc of the tret. So I had to add products to address that. Finally found the balance and now my skin is happy and so am I.

In terms of choosing products, I look for those that are intended to meet the need that I have. Sometimes it's based on a long track record of proven results (tret for acne). Other resources include recommendations from people who have similar skin type/needs, understanding what ingredients are likely to be beneficial or harmful to my skin in particular based on past experience, expert advice on specific products that are good for people with my needs (e.g. lists of good moisturizers for people on tret). But there's also some element of trial and error, which requires closely observing your skin to see how it reacts to new products and figuring out what you need to do different to better meet its needs.",14
긍정,"I research what most of the common ingredients are, what they’re supposed to do and what issues they target best and work from there. And then trial and error. I know it’s not that simple since I haven’t finished out my permanent routine either but this is how I approached it. I also enjoy watching videos about products and what people with my issues are doing but I know that’s not the most helpful per individual",16
중립,"Address one skin concern at a time, go from thinnest to thickest?",8
중립,"The Core: 
- One hydrator (humectant) to pull water into your skin 
- One moisturizer (emollient) that reinforces your skin barrier with skin-identical ingredients (cermaides + cholesterol + fatty acids) 
- One gentle cleanser 
- One SPF 

Above that: 
- One active that addresses my specific skin needs OR 
- Prescription actives if my skin requires them  

I work in a scientific/science - adjacent field, and really enjoy my peer-reviewed research papers lol. It’s fun bedtime reading. My actives are a retinoid and Azelaic Acid, both of which are indicated for my skin condition. This, in addition to the ‘core’ is all I need. Sure, I do enjoy experimentation with a new product once in a while, but I like a minimalistic system. I also travel for work a lot, so I can’t carry half a dozen things with me. Each product I choose has to play a specific role that is established through research, and I only need one of each. Beyond that, if I choose to add something, it’s only about preference.",6
중립,"AM: cleanse, AA, moisturizer, sunscreen. PM: Cleanse, Taz",3
중립,"I keep it simple with cleanse only if needed, vitamin C, moisturizer, and sunscreen in the morning, then cleanse, retinoid, and moisturizer at night; I choose products by sticking to well-studied actives like retinoids, vitamin C, niacinamide, and azelaic acid, patch testing and adding one change for 2 to 4 weeks while tracking my skin and skipping trends until results are consistent.",3
중립,"Lots of trial and error and getting over the feeling of wanting to try every new trending product.

My current routine is AM: water rinse, toner, peptide serum, moisturizer, maybe sunscreen

PM: cleanser, toner, peptide serum or tretinoin, moisturizer",3
중립,"You answered your own question: Do what your skin needs. Only you know what your skin needs. You didn’t even say what your skincare goals are, so that makes it hard for people to offer input. It takes time and trial and error to scale down a routine that fits your needs. 

Also, lotion is not optional when you use retinoids. And it definitely isn’t when you use retinoids AND vitamin c daily. One thing about a “minimalist” routine is that it can actually be harmful to the barrier when you remove basic products. The scaling back needs to be thoughtful and reasonable. It isn’t just removing items; it’s also about knowing what to keep. Anything that supports your barrier and hydration should be in the routine. Whether you need niacinamide and Aza—only you know that.

I personally have a “base routine.” It is products that I use every single day, no matter what. From there, I bring in actives as I need them based on what I’m trying to achieve. It took me about three years to get the base routine down. So, I’d say be patient and intentional about the scaled-back routine, and be prepared for it take it a while to get it right.",3
중립,"I have adhd and low executive function so here’s my absolute bare minimum when I can’t keep up with life. my main focus is hydration. I use an oil cleanser and gel cleanser at the end of the day. 

AM: toner pad, sunscreen.

PM: reedle shot 100, tirtir milk toner (has niacinamide), tirtir ceramic ampoule (is pretty heavy so I usually skip moisturiser) - this is the combo I rely on the most. 

OR

PM: reedle shot, toner, whatever sheet mask

OR

PM: cosrx abc toner, melano cc premium essence (vitamin c), moisturiser - my skin is really sensitive so I’m gradually building resistance to eventually use stronger AHA/BHA and vitamin c.

I have other products like retinol and azelaic acid (trying this out for my rosacea) that I do use on good days. but when the days are bad I just stick to my bare minimum.",3
긍정,"I pared way back this year due to a lot of skin concerns that I feel were linked to just overdoing it for so long. I’m trying not to get bogged down by viral products and also eliminating redundancies. I use a combo of my own derm’s advice and taking note of products that come up repeatedly on social media derm accounts.

My main targets are acne and hyperpigmentation. My AM is gentle cleanser, vit C, lotion, sunscreen. PM is double cleanse, lotion, and alternate between tret/AHA/BHA. I also play things by ear a lot based on how my skin is doing that day. My goal has been to get to the point where I feel good going out without any concealer or coverup because I was just in this endless cycle of breaking out, concealing, breaking out even more, etc. And after half a year of my new routine I’ve really turned a corner.",2
긍정,"I would say bare minimum is a cleanser, moisturizer and spf. This is sufficient enough for am and pm routine if that all your skin needs.

If it needs more then:

1) figure out your skin type

2) what skin concern(s) are you trying to address

3) look into products that help that skin concern. Read online reviews, compare reviews on YouTube, reddit the official site etc. to gauge. If people had issues with the product see why, and what issues caused.

4) pop all the items you are interested in your cart, and asses them together as a whole routine or addition to your current routine and with your budget. The goal to to not have too many repetitive products, as too many products can also cause a negative effect. Also question whether this is smth you really need or are getting cause it's hyped up online and you've seen ""amazing"" effects. Chances are if your skin is already doing well you don't need to add anything.

5) let the thought marinate before buying

6) be consistent with using it once you get it, your not gonna see immediate results",2
중립,"AM - Isntree Yam Root Milk cleanser, Mixsoon Glacier Water serum(/toner), Medicube TXA/Niacinamide serum, Medicube Booster Pro, Dr G RED Blemish cream, Medicube Ultra Tune after skincare is fully absorbed, and SPF 50 PA++++ physical sunscreen if I used retinal the night before, or chemical if not.

PM - oil cleanser if I applied sunscreen that day, Isntree Milk cleanser, exfoliating clay mask 2 times a week, TONYMOLY Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner, Medicube TXA/Niacinamide serum, Meditherapy Retinal Skin Booster (every other night), Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye serum, Medicube Salmon PDRN serum, Medicube Booster Pro (some days I will only use this in the AM so that I can apply VT Cosmetics Reedle Shot right after cleanser and before toner), either Medicube Collagen Jelly Cream if I did Booster Pro MC/derma shot mode that night, or TONYMOLY Wonder Ceramide Water cream if not, a hydrogel mask 3 times a week, and Medicube Ultra Tune after everything is fully absorbed.

I didn’t think I was doing much, until I typed it all out just now. 😅 looks like my version of minimal is not so minimal after all, haha!",2
중립,"I have 2 rules. 
- 1: my morning routine needs to be simple. If i use anything between a water cleanse (or rarely a micellar water) and my sinscreen, it needs to be frickin effective. In my case, it's mostly zinc PCA, bakuchiol and/or one of those stabile vitCs, cos i know those work. Maybe a random face mist to combat heat throughout the day.
- 2: no using actives on retinol night. So i don't use retinol every time, more like every other night, and the other fun things can go in between. (On that note: mists/toners can be fun. Essences and serums should be targeted and chosen for the active ingredient, at least in my routine.)",2
중립,"Long routines stress me out and I don't like feeling things on my skin/it being sticky. So in the morning I literally just cleanse (if I used active ingredients the night before) and suncream.

Night is Double cleanse, toner, eye cream, moisturiser, retinal (3 times weekly)",2
중립,"I have a basic routine in which I use mosstly the same products daily, but rotate the actives, as some of them I find too irritating for daily use. I also have an acid toner (Some By Mi AHA BHA PHA) that I use 1-2 times a month or when I feel the need. 

AM:

* water “cleanse” or mild cleanser
* gokujyun (Hada Labo)
* moisturizing serum (cosrx snail mucin)
* active serum and/or light moisturizer 
* sunscreen

PM:

* double cleanse (oil + mild cleanser)
* gokujyun (Hada Labo)
* moisturizing serum (cosrx snail mucin)
* retinoid or peptide serum or reedle shot (I use retinoid every 2-3 days)
* heavier moisturizer",2
긍정,"How I determine what actives I’m choosing for a more streamlined routine has multiple factors:

A. Does this address more than one of *my* skin issues?

B. Have I used this active (or product) and found positive results? Or have I had better results in other actives or products?

C. Does it have long term benefits or been researched on? What does the medical literature suggest? Is it a fad?

My routine has both Asian skincare and American skincare so I won’t list out the exact products in my routine. I allotted one ‘additional’ product that wasn’t part of the core set that you listed (cleanse, moisturize, sun protection, retinoid). Has to be a good product that you’ve gotten amazing results with it, wouldn’t want to go without kind of thing.

My routine:
AM: no cleanse, just sunscreen before I do makeup
PM: double cleanse, toner (this is my chosen additional product), alternate Azelaic Acid and Retinoid, and moisturize!

My skin concerns are acne, redness (Rosacea), combo skin that’s prone to buildup of oils and dead skin but also gets dehydrated, also get PIE from pimples. So I wanted something that’s both soothing and hydrating with very mild exfoliation. 

If it helps at all, I discovered my hg toner because an app that analyzes your skin and helps make suggestions based on your skin type, preferences, with data of what you’ve tried before and liked/disliked. I don’t want to sound like an ad so I won’t mention the name unless someone asks me.",3
긍정,"Through trial and error, I have a ""base"" that works for me. The base is face wash, hyaluronic acid serum, moisturizer, sunscreen. 

From there, I add actives based on what I want to focus on. For example, about three months ago I added azelaic acid in the morning because I've heard good things and I haven't tried it before, despite having redness. Because my base is solid, when I introduce a new product I can relatively quickly see if it works for me or not; azelaic acid did. 

I only introduce one new product at a time.",1
중립,"What you have listed is basically my routine. I make my routine by looking at what my skin needs, I don’t think about products first. I used to buy a lot of new products because I wanted to try it all, but with new products coming out so frequently I’ve learned to simplify my routine to what I really need.

I.e.:
What kind of cleanser do I need? Hydrating cream cleanser for daily night use? Something with SA for post-workouts?

What skin issues am I really targeting? What kind of discoloration - brown vs red? Etc",1
중립,"I travel a lot and often don’t check in luggage. As a result my skincare routine needs to be as simple as possible and I need to minimize liquids. Here goes: cleanser (HABA bar soap), Shiseido Ultimune serum, Round Lab Dokdo cream. That’s it.",1
긍정,Perfect answer.,2
중립,"I found the top-down approach to be easier for myself (otherwise I'd be way more lost and overwhelmed by all the available stuff on the market):

- Identify main skin concerns and know your skin type
- Rank in order of importance/largest impact 
- research clinically backed ingredients that address the top 1-2 concerns. Often, ingredients may have multiple benefits, and sometimes ingredients have different chemical forms, differing pros/cons (e.g. faster results but also increased risk of irritation), and sometimes have concentrations that are more effective vs more gentle. Pick one or two ingredients that address the top concern(s).
- Set a budget for how much you want to spend, then research the products that have your key ingredient at a clinically effective concentration. Narrow down to 3 max to consider.
- To decide between products, I compare online reviews (I find 3-4 star reviews to be more reliable), see if anyone on reddit with similar skin type and issues have shared their experience with the product, and see if any dermatologists online have reviewed the product. All sponsored reviews are taken with a large grain of salt, I generally don't trust/look for input from influencers either, but in this day and age we are all susceptible lol.
- Price and ease of purchase/receipt of product also is considered. I often add items to the cart and let it sit for at least a day, if not a week. That way I can be more confident it's not an impulse buy bc I was influenced into it.
- After receiving it, know that consistency is key when applying products. Also, introduce new products slowly (especially if the ingredients are known to be irritating), then increase the frequency I use it",11

부정,"# I bought Apagard Premio on Amazon, how do I know it's not a counterfeit

So, I have been using my Apagard Premio from Amazon and I watched a video that mentioned that if I use Nano Hydroxypatite, after washing my teeth I should get a gritty feeling on my teeth from the Hydroxypatite crystalization, so I started to have doubts on my tooth paste as I never get a gritty sensation afterwards on my teeth, then I got from Google's ai that the paste itself should be soft and it shouldn't have a gritty, sandy texture like other toothpastes, can someone confirm if that's true? The one I bought has indeed a sandy texture when I bite into it, the box is very pretty but now I am unsure, help!  
I need to know multiple things:

1. Have I wasted money TT . TT

긍정,">hydrocolloid patches are for pimples that have already come to a head—yknow, the big white ball of pus—so the fluid can be sucked out.

Not to be a big nerd (even though I am) but that's actually not what they are for or do. You can put these patches on any type of pimple or mark caused from inflammation and it will be reduced, because these patches dont actually work by sucking the pus but instead creating a tiny microenviornment (thats sealed and moist) between the patch and your skin that's perfect for wound healing and absorbing any excess fluid.",121

For the users who don’t know, the Romand JLT has allegedly been causing a lot of allergic reactions (cheilitis), so Romand recalled their JLTs and has been working on renewing their product to “JLT Zero”. You can find more information online or on Romand’s official Instagram page.

Edit: Romand will continue to sell JLT but are offering refunds.",180
중립,"afaik, only the juicy lasting tints were involved in the controversy and the other products are fine, so i think it's fine to still buy the other lip products in their range.",54
부정,"I’m waiting. I didn’t like the reformulation even before this controversy. I repurchased Bare Grape  in the new formula shortly after launch and it is not the same color imo. 

The new formula is more drying and intense in color, which is disappointing. I’ve always preferred a lot of other brands’ lip formulas, but I kept buying Romand because of their muted color selection. The formula vs color tradeoff is no longer worth it.",27
중립,"I'm out of the loop, what controversy?",70
중립,You’re missing some key context here OP. Some of us haven’t heard of this controversy,66
중립,I’m not buying their lip products. I just don’t understand why they would change a formula that got them that big and popular in the first place. Hopefully they just go back to their original formula.,31
중립,"Honestly, no. I’ve tried old and new JLT, but both drying.",9
중립,"I think that the culprits are also certain shades of the new formulation of JLT, so I am leaning towards a colorant being the problem.

I have a new formula Plum Coke that feels great on my lips (although it tastes terrible if I place my tongue on my lips for long enough to melt the film).

Even this person who has experienced it with Bare Grape didn't with the Dark Coconut they had.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/s/k5OifiIUxi

I probably won't be buying new shades until they reformulate, because the affected shades are pretty unclear, and people unaffected could just have one of the safe shades or are just have really resilient lips. I would buy confirmed safe shades that I like through.

Sucks because I genuinely do like the new JLT and it's a cute product when it's not dangerous.",7
긍정,I think Romand was a great gateway for me to discover Asian beauty lip products and color range but since then I’ve branched away and found imo better options.,11
중립,"Nope. Decided to try Entropy, Timephoria, and Fwee meanwhile",5
중립,"I bought a couple of lip tints from them a few years ago and noticed that i would get a tingling sensation on my lips and then some red bumps. I tried again a year later and still had the same problem, from most of their different lines of lip tints.

Never had a problem with any other brands though, so I stopped buying anything from them /:",5
긍정,"This is news to me! I just bought the reformulated Peeling Angdoo and Mulled Peach and I was admiring how nicely they look on me and how much more hydrating they are compared to the old formula. I think I got some from a good batch. 

I’m sad others are experiencing reactions and I’m looking forward to trying the new formula whenever it comes out.",5
중립,"I'm not doubting that people got cheilitis from their Romand tints, but I think it became this whole issue just because their lip tints (especially the Juicy Lasting Tint) are SOOO popular. Larger sample size = higher chance of people reporting reactions.",4
중립,What??? I use the juicy lip tints for a over a year and I have never had any issues. What is the controversy??,11
긍정,"personally waiting for the reformulation even if i didnt experience irritation with the new formula but also i've sort of stopped buying from romand since i think their shades are leaning much brighter and neon looking these days. I remember when they first started they're good at making those muted mlbb shades but with the last reformulation they sort of have lost that vision? i didnt like the thinner formula either, the old JLTs were a bit thicker

nowadays i've got my eyes on nuse instead, which is romand's sister brand. i think nuse is doing well with their blushes, they had some really good muted shades. not so sure about the lip tints but eh",3
중립,"To be honest, I’ll never use Rom&nd products again. Customers have been raising concerns for months, and yet there was no response until now, that’s not how a responsible company should act. I also experienced dryness and irritation on my lips, but at first, I thought it was just because my skin was sensitive and I was tired. It took almost a month for my lips to get better, and even now they’re not completely healed. They should’ve apologized from the very beginning.",6
긍정,"I was going to buy one and then heard it had for dry lips anyway, this controversy just made me not want to buy it at all, despite the colours looking really nice. I ended up getting the tir tir ones and even though the colour selection isn’t as appealing it’s good for dry lips.",3
중립,I won't rebuy regardless if they fix the issue because I don't like the JLT reformulation to begin with.  I find that I can get the same/similar color payoff and gloss/shine from other brands that I like in better formulas so why would I go back.,3
중립,Well this explains SO MANY THINGS.,3
중립,"I never had an issue so I still use them. However I use the balms more than the tints, although I haven’t had issues with the tints

But I wouldn’t blame people for being cautious if they want to be",3
중립,I’ve had no issues thus far so ya I prob will tbh I can’t lie,4
중립,Im not buying their products anymore but its rather because of the fact that they reformulated them in the first place and they cut the amount of product by more than a third of it lol.,2
중립,  I bought the old ones RIGHT before the reformulation so I'm definitely going to wait,2
중립,"Waiting for the new formulation. I developed an allergy to their glasting lip balms and their juicy lasting lip tint. Granted, I developed allergies to a lot of lip products, so Romand isn't the exception.",2
중립,Is it only the JLTs that have been reported to cause cheilitis? I have the Glasting Water Tints and Blur Fudge Tints from Romand and am wondering if I should just get rid of them all!,2
중립,"This makes so much sense! I bought new JLTs in Pomelo Skin, Nucadamia and Eat Dotori last month and had to stop using them because I had really sore, dry lips for weeks on end. 

Thanks for posting OP!",2
중립,"Haven’t tried the jlt, but bought the wgt in 2023 and it irritated my throat so I had to toss it out. Thought it was just me who had a problem with romand..",2
중립,ive never had a reaction to their products and i have quite a few!,2
중립,"Oh. My. God. Is that what that was? 

I have been fighting dry, flaky lips for a month now without knowing what it is or what caused it!!

Never had dried lips before this summer, and while I suspected JLTs, cheilitis didn't go away even after I stopped using them, so I just assumed it must've been something else, like dehydration.

Thanks for posting this OP, because I somehow missed this news when it first came out 😭",1
중립,"Damn it, I literally got my first one today -_-",1
중립,"I use dewyful water tint, so the only thing stopping me from buying is lack of sales on romand lip products on yesstyle lol. I was never really interested in jlt as I prefer natural-looking, hydrating products. I also like the packaging of dwt more, especially milk grocery line.",1
중립,"I had cheilitis from their JLT back in 2020 with their older shades, so I've already sworn off all Romand lip products :(",1
부정,No wonder my lips were drying so much and became chapped after using juicy lasting tint. Taste was also terrible after application. The only ointment that treated my lips was Lucas papaw. I switched to Peripera after this experience.,1
중립,"Yes, the colors that I have from them (Mellow Pear and Nutty Vague) are my favorite among all the lippies I own, and they're cheaper compared to other k-liptints for me too. For JLT, I'll probably only try the old formulation and not the new one.",1
중립,"Me reading all these comments while looking at my 8+ JLTs and realizing that I must have lips of steel. It must be A'pieu's Honey Milk Lip Oil that is saving me. If you suffer from super dry lips or have a hard time with lip sores, then I highly recommend this, especially if you own a lot of Romand prouct like I do. 👍",1
중립,Oh no! I was wondering why I had chilitis when I woke up and I just started wearing the JLT three weeks ago on and off.,1
중립,I ordered some on Yesstyle before hearing about it and now they wont let me cancel. bought 3 and dont know what to do w them..,1
긍정,Still using (and repurchasing) their glasting water tints - best lip tints I’ve ever tried.,1
긍정,"My mileage varied with individual Rom&nd lip products. The product I find most drying is is their matte lipstick, which isn't a tint at all. Their original JLT is still one of my my go-tos and I never had a problem with it. However, I really didn't like the reformulated JLT and found it less moisturizing than other tints with similar thickness. Their Glasting water tint was also less moisturizing than other tints with a similar thickness, but I really like the effect and staining power. On the contrary, while I didn't find their Dewyful water tint drying at all, I had so many other issues with it that despite loving the shade I own, I never reach for it.

I'd repurchase their original JLT without hesitation if I could find them between all its reformulations, but I'll likely wait for them to reformulate before repurchasing other lip products. I have a good enough collection of lip product currently, and none of their other products appeal to me enough for a repurchase.",1
긍정,"thank you for the help explaining, i've edited the post now!!

i can relate, it's just my luck that i wanted to buy another JLT after panning mine and I somehow panned it in the midst of the controversy haha.........",4
중립,What’s the dye/ingredient that is causing irritation in the new formulation?,1
중립,Do you know the batch number or year of the JLT? Cause I have some that are older that I still use (I know I know I should throw them out since they probably have a shelf life of 12 months) but I'll throw them out officially if it affects all of them vs recently produced.,16
긍정,"thank you for the help explaining, i've edited the post now!! tbh, it's not my fav formula from them either, but their shade range and price are hard to ignore 🫠",6
중립,"They recalled their JLTs? But they’re still selling them, they’re on the shelf at Olive young in Korea still - so is that a new formula replacing the formula  with the irritants, or they’re still selling the ones causing allergic reactions?",6
중립,aah really 😭 my friend told me she saw people talking about the dewyful water tint.. that's even worse news for me since i recently panned one of their JLTs and wanted to buy another shade,-5
중립,This is the reason why i haven’t purchased the new ones. I really like the milky aspect of the old formula!,6
부정,Their online swatches were incredibly deceiving after the reformulation. I hate panned my JLT because it looked bright pink in person while it looked very muted online.,3
중립,"oh i didn't know about that!! i also wanted to buy one of their more muted shades (pomelo skin), but if it's brighter in the new formulation then it's not worth it at all for me either",2

중립,What's your skin type?,2
중립,"Highly recommend giving the new user guide a read. Part 2 goes into routine building. For barrier repair, you'll want products with ceramides. Barrier creams can be hard to get right with oily skin because most of them are pretty heavy. So I recommend a toner instead— celimax dual barrier toner. It's a milky toner with 5 ceramides


For the rest of your routine, after reading the new user guide, try doing a search on the sub for ""your skin type"" and ""product type"". There are a lot of product recommendation threads",1
중립,"Outside of sunscreens, the majority of products have the same formulation. Though the ingredients list may look different, a lot of the time, it's due to different regulations on how ingredients list are disclosed. So ingredients under one umbrella term may have to be listed separately in some countries or the order may change",3
중립,"Some products have different formulations for the US. Off the top of my head, I know the Numbuzin No. 9 NAD+ Bio Lifting-sil Essence and the Sungboon Editor Green Tomato Pore Lifting Ampoule have different formulations because the Korean versions have NMN. NMN is approved as a dietary supplement in the US but I don't think it's allowed in skincare (Google says this has been reversed??), so the companies omitted it from the US market versions. I don't know how common this is outside of sunscreens though.",1

긍정,Thank you! Since my skin is oily I was thinking of doing a heavier and more nourishing  barrier cream at night and something more lightweight during the day for under makeup. After perusing the sub I actually just ordered the celimax toner along with purito centella serum and the cosrx comfort cream. I also have the Benton aloe propolis gel for daytime use since it’s lightweight.,1

긍정,"Don't be sorry. This looks like a good foundation. The curel intensive moisturizing cream is pretty heavy duty. I would go for their facial moisturizing cream instead


I don't know which Biore sunscreen you plan on getting but a decent number of them are water resistant. A water-based (second) cleanser won't be enough to remove it at night. Highly recommend adding an oil cleanser to your PM routine. My favorite is the fancl mild cleansing oil

중립,"I have the sensitive skin version which is unscented, and the main two things I notice compared to my HG (BoJ Aqua Fresh, which is not waterproof) is that it takes longer to rub in and is drying. There is also a slight white cast, but it doesn't show on my skin.

I do also get some burning if it is too close to my eyes, but that is very person-specific and happens to me with many sunscreens.

긍정,"I have been using this as my under-makeup sunscreen for a while now (at least over half a year, maybe closer to a year at this point). no issues with stinging, fragrance, etc. I have combo skin where the oily parts are super oily, and it does OK with keeping the oiliness in check. absolutely do still need an oil-blocking/mattifying primer on long days where I need better longevity, but for an average day at work, I just make do and blot a bit as necessary. (for reference I use the primer by Primavista - not perfect either, and can be slightly drying depending on your skin, but makes a noticeable difference on the days I do use it)

I do not see any pilling 9.9 days out of 10, but I experienced it once recently, while using my normal products. I was definitely rushing a bit and the serum and gel moisturizer I used probably hadn't had enough time to soak into my skin, which I think had something to do with it. I have used the same combo before applying the Anessa before with zero issues, so I think giving your skincare several minutes to dry down (at least for gel moisturizers, which do dry down quickly - you may need more time for richer moisturizers) can help with pilling.",4

긍정,"The anessa perfect uv sunscreen skincare milk was such a disappointment after all the hype in this sub. I found it to be very sticky, pretty heavy and uncomfortable, even a while after applying. My makeup also did not sit well on top of it and it would cause pilling and separation. I was also a little sensitive to it, probably in part due to the higher alcohol concentration compared to other AB sunscreens. It would especially sting around my eyes. And on top of everything else, it’s a bit overpriced. 

For context, I have mildly sensitive, slightly dry skin with occasional mild acne flare-ups (former Accutane user). And I live in a warm, dry climate. 

There are better sunscreens out there for more reasonable prices. I’m really liking house of hur weightless sun fluid right now. I also preferred Numbuzin no. 1 clear filter sun essence and Tocobo bio watery sun essence wayyy over the anessa. 

The only major pro for this sunscreen vis a vis other AB sunscreens is that it’s waterproof. But tbh I’d rather use a non-ab waterproof sunscreen on summer days in the outdoors than the anessa. And for regular days in the office, running errands, etc., I’d go for house of hur, Numbuzin or Tocobo over the anessa.",3

3. Greasy. This sunscreen is more greasy than other milk sunscreens I tried. I would have to put a bit of powder so that I won't look oily after a few hours outside, which makes it hard to reapply.",3
중립,"Combo-oily in humid climate here: this popular Japanese sun milk goes on very matte and sets fast, can sting my eyes from the alcohol and fragrance, emphasizes dry patches in cooler months, and pills if layered over silicone-rich moisturizers or reapplied too soon.

긍정,"I actually really enjoy this sunscreen, it has good tenacity, is matte and lightweight, great for hot and humid sweaty weather and oily skin.

But there are a few things I hate about it:

It really hurts and stings if it runs into your eyes, I cannot apply this near my eyes.

The formulation is difficult to remove and you need a good makeup remover/oil cleanser (which could also be a plus).

If you touch your face and then your phone or even if your phone screen touches your face during a call, this sunscreen leaves a hard to remove smudge on your screen.",3
중립,"It makes my skin so dry and reapplication is uncomfortable , feel like rubbing sand on face and greasy too. Im currently use purito sunscreen ( orange one) and it much better , although its slightly dewy/sticky when freshly apply.",5
중립,"Based from all the replies I guess its a very absorbent sunscreen, to oil, sweat and even moisture. Oily skin types would probably benefit from it more since theres more oil to absorb, whereas itd be drying to the opposite skin types. My skin isnt that oily and its more on the dehydrated side tho so I guess it wont work for me😔 ",2
긍정,"It’s been my daily sunscreen for a few months, I used to wear BOJ and needed something more hard wearing. I have kind of a love/hate relationship with it to be honest. Yet I keep using it because I’m worried about  new stuff breaking me out randomly. I mostly enjoy that it’s impossible to sweat/rub off once set, I have not stained any of my light coloured tops/hoodies which used to be an issue. Sometimes the talc can leave some white powdery residue but it doesn’t stain. Taking it off is the main concern to avoid clogging, careful oil cleansing is needed. I don’t wear skincare under. Sometimes it comes out uneven, a random spot will peel then other days it looks amazing like a filter. It’s shiny and tone-up on my already very fair skin. The white cast seems unavoidable unless you under-apply. Sensitivity-wise I love it, surprisingly, even though I’m eczema/dermatitis prone but keep in mind it is not FA safe. Since using it I have much less pigmentation from spots (which makes me think BOJ was not enough). I mostly don’t like that it feels thick on the skin (due to silicone) and reapplying is weird because it won’t really sink in like the first layer (but necessary). If for any reason I don’t reapply, at the end of the day my skin feels quite dry. I wonder if a reformulation will happen at some point too.",2
중립,"I have combo skin that doesn't react easily and tolerates new products, and I live in humid climate. 


I have previously used Canmake Mermaid Skin gel and currently my HG is BoJ Relief Sun aqua-fresh.


I gave a fair try to Anessa during 3 months combining it with different products but it was impossible to use it. It stung my eyes and was pilling with every product, and the perfume was incredible strong. ",2
긍정,"My skin type is dry dehydrated and acne prone, living in dry winters humid summers climate. I tried the regular one before the most recent reformulation and it was not a pleasant experience for me. Feels drying (even in summer) and powdery, and the scent is too strong for my liking.  

More recently i tried the mild milk version to use on a 2-day hiking. As an outdoor sunscreen it's fantastic (and so was the regular one iirc) and i barely tan at all. But it felt even worse than the regular one lol. It felt more drying and extremely whitecasty even for my light skin and doesn't work well with my base makeup so i only use this on my body now.

Tbh skin aqua is way better for my skin type.",2

중립,"I think you left out a question. What else are people using under it as that may cause their pilling or why it slides into their eyes.

This is the only sunscreen that does not get in my eyes and sting. I tone, use a Vitamin C serum, use Rejuran Ampule, the Aestura Cream mist, Astor’s cream, then Anessa Sun milk.

Skin is sensitive, rosacea. I live in a mild, not humid unless the summer and nothing like a SE Asian humid or southern US humid.",1
중립,It sweats off so easily and I am a person who normally isn't that sweaty/oily,1
중립,"I liked how lightweight it felt, but it did pill a bit over moisturizer and made my dry areas more noticeable (combo-dry skin, humid climate). Might work better for oily skin types.",1
중립,My skin is combo/dehydrated. Found it hard to spread around easily and it made my skin feel like it was on fire.,1
중립,"Tried it in Japan - it’s extremely matte on me and leaves a white cast.

Went with biore instead for this reason.",1
중립,"from a person who experiences both pros and cons:

the texture and finish is way lighter than the typical kolmar sunscreens I've tried and used (thin milk vs cream). so it's a lot easier for me to apply the correct amount and actually put it on. I just don't feel it on my face as much as the cream sunscreens like BOJ (which may be opposite to how others feel). it's one of the only ss that doesn't bother my eyes. most ss sting my eyes. It is known for its very high protection esp bc of how tenacious it is so I trust it the most lol.

can be drying if used often due to mineral filters. the slight white cast makes me self conscious.

for me, the pros do outweigh the cons, but only in the summer when there is strong sun for most of the day.",1
긍정,"I bet the Senka Perfect Whip cleanser would get it off.  Your skin would be stripped as hell, but the sunscreen would be gone, lmao.",16
중립,"Stings my eyes, too. The Mild Milk did not when I last used it, but it's not very cosmetically elegant, and for that price, I can find another inelegant sunscreen locally.",2
중립,"Yes, definitely leaves a white cast on darker skin tones. It makes me look ghoulish",2
중립,which Missha? the sun milk with the pink cap?,3
긍정,"The pink version is called Mild Milk and it's fragrance, alcohol and colorant- free so it's perfect for those with sensitive skin. I prefer this version so much more than the regular one, so just in case you still want to try it I would choose this version",3
중립,"I guess I’m a bit of an outlier here and maybe the sunscreen has a different formulation where ai am—but I’ve used this sunscreen for nearly five years have very sensitive dry skin undergoing retinoid treatment and I’m also eczema prone. The weather where I am cycles through hot and VERY humid, and really dry windy winters.

The gold bottle is my favourite one after cycling through many popular Japanese sunscreens (I’m based in Japan). Like others said, the alcohol, white cast and mild fragrance might cause issues though, but it never really did for me. To compare, the popular Biore Watery Essence and Nivea UV cut variants burned and irritated the bajeezus out of my skin (alcohol content makes those ones feel astringent) and other sunscreens went on like white paint in comparison to this one. After that experience, to me Anessa felt similar to LRP’s Anthelios.

I’m surprised that many find the difficulty in washing the product off as a negative. It IS difficult to wash off—which makes it so that it doesn’t slip around and slide into my eyes during really hot or rainy days. To remove it, I use an oil cleanser (I use Muji mild cleansing) or micellar water (on lazy days I use Bifesta)—foaming cleansers will likely strip your skin as you rub your face trying to remove it, which I guess exacerbates whatever irritation is being reported. 

It sits well after my skincare and I find no problem with it interacting with my makeup or reapplication—it acts like a smoothing primer even. If I have a dry patch or a flareup, I try to get all of my required moisture in before putting on sunscreen (as well as medication), and I try to make sure that my skincare and makeup don’t repel each other (which is what causes pilling).

I know you probably have decided, but I thought since we had the same skin type, these are some addt’l points for consideration!",1
중립,That cleanser can even cleanse my soul 💀,18
중립,Might not have skin left after as a tazarotene user lol,6
중립,i only use a pinky nail’s amt of that cleanser each time. if i use anymore i’ll be washing it off for hours. but my skin will feel so clean like it regenerated during the cleanse,2
중립,Replying again because I misread your question sorry! The one I use rn is the aqua gel in the white and blue packaging,3
중립,The original sun milk in the gold bottle! I haven’t seen the pink one around when I used to purchase,1
긍정,"Ill look into it, thank you!",1
중립,"Thats very interesting! It might be that ur moisturizing products are so moisturizing that it cancels out the dryness of the sunscreen (cuz dry skin care routine?). Or, it really just works well for you! I guess Ill have to put more thought into deciding hehe",1
중립,Ikr.  It’s INTENSE.,2
긍정,Perfect for Halloween?  😂😭😂😭,5
중립,haha that's ok! does that have a matte finish by chance?,1
중립,Are you perhaps confusing Anessa with Missha?  I’m not familiar with Missha in a gold bottle.,1
긍정,Thank you for the amazing swatches OP! This is next level! The swatches on the paper vs on the skin makes this so helpful.,2
부정,How is the staining power of the Laka? I loved the color range of Laka fruity glam tint but I hate needing to reapply all the time.,3
긍정,"it's not a tint so it doesn't stain at all :) I didn't find it particularly long lasting but it looks and feels so good, I don't mind reapplying",4
중립,"Oh duh. I see it's labeled as a lipstick now. Honestly, the color is soooo beautiful. I'm on a no-buy right now but it's seriously so tempting 😭🥺",2

I have fine, dense, wavy hair and it works well. It comes with straightening and curling accessories in the same box. Very convenient.",4
긍정,"Panasonic Nano series is still the good one if you are looking at function + cost. Lab muffin has done a review on them. In a nut shell, she said, look for one with the scalp function or had that. That is the ideal heat setting to prevent scalp dry out or hair damage. 

A lot do use the D brand due to marketing and the compactness compared to the Nano size.",3
중립,"As far as I know, Koreans use Dyson products a lot. haha",1
긍정,"Im late to the Clio buzz! I finally got Clio Lash Kill, i picked the new fine version, and i love it! 

The brush is so thin, small & precise. As someone not used to using mascara and always get smudges on upper lids, im amazed on how easy is it to use. It does hold a curl very well, no clumps, lashes are wispy feathery and no panda eyes even after a sweat sesh at the gym! The hype is real... Heroine was clumpy too thick for me… My lower lashes tho are still a challenge bec they’re almost non-existent so i end up getting more mascara on my undereye than the tiny hairs.",15
긍정,"Has anyone tried the Judydoll iron mascaras? Heard great things about it for short asian lashes, but curious if it’s true.",10
중립,100% the kiss me heroine mascara. When I use it people tell me I look like I have falsies on,12
긍정,TheSeam mascara is pretty good for people with oily skin. Not clumpy and doesn’t smudge. It does flake a little bit though.,5
긍정,"I have the same eyelashes and I swear by judydoll’s iron mascara! I’m blessed with the genes of ANNOYINGLY straight Asian eyelashes. This mascara holds it upright even after 8 hours of wear. I do curl my lashes before applying :)

I’ve been buying this as gifts for my mom and even friends for their birthdays because that’s how much I love it 😂",3
중립,"Uh I don't know about dramatic but my go tos are: etude house lash fix mascara, lash kill clio mascara and Maybelline sky high :)",3
긍정,"Eyelash curler + Romand Han All Fix mascara (Long Ash & Long Hazel) has been good for me. They have some lengthening fibers, and if too clumpy I just comb through it with a clean spoolie.

I also have a Clio Kill Lash waiting in storage once I'm done with the Romand ones.",3
중립,i feel like judy doll only doesnt really volumize or lengthen much so keep that in mind,3
중립,I also have short lashes and monolid. And I use Kissme Micro mascara! It's light and slim but it doesn't make lashes super long or dramatic...,2
긍정,I wipe off excess product on the wand before applying to my lashes. I've tried so many mascaras and found this method to work best despite the formula.,1
중립,"Deja vu lengthening mascara, it has a fibre technology that makes your eyelashes longer instead of volumising. Judydoll iron mascara also has a similar effect.",1
중립,judydoll's iron masacara! this thing has made my short af lashes look so long and doesn't smudge or flake and is waterproof! it feels super light. People complain about it being hard to remove but with a mascara remove rlike the make heroine one it comes off so easily and doesn't take lashes off.,1
중립,"Romand han all fix mascara in volume black! Not a fan of dramatic lashes but this one really made my eyelashes looked like i have falsies on. I also find it easy to use, the mascara wand applies the product evenly.",1
중립,has anyone tried the Kbeauty trick of burning a toothpick and then using it to curl the lashes? i’m terrified to try,1
중립,judydoll!,1
긍정,I have to try it out then! Thank you for your rec and experience! Does it give a more dramtic look as well? I'm really into spikey long lashes 🙀,1
긍정,I swear by judydoll iron mascara!! Lengthens and volumizes my straight lashes so well + no smudging too. I especially love the Volume and Curling Mascara Duo version with the fibers ✌🏼,10
긍정,"I love the Judydoll iron mascara! I am in the PNW. 

For a long time I used the Herione Make Mascara which helped lengthen and make lashes look quite dramatic, but they smudged SO much on my lids and under eyes (I have oily skin). 

Switched to Romand All Han mascara which helped define my lashes, no smudging, but I felt like after a long day, they didn’t hold up. 

Switched to Judydoll, they don’t look as dramatic but that’s fine. They last all day (sometimes even when I sleep lol) and do not smudge at all. They’re also a bit more affordable than the other two. 

I don’t curl my lashes tho so I’m really asking for my mascara to work miracles lol.",3
긍정,"Short and oily Asian lashes here, hot and humid climate.  

I am not that big of a fan for this one. It doesnt separate as much as my other good mascaras, and it is not as volumising. It does lengthen and I do like the dark brown colour. I also like that I can heat it directly with my blowdry. The curl lasts about 4 hours for me if i apply heat and curl my lashes really well. 

However not everyone shares my opinion and I'm sad it didnt work out for me. It is quite affordable where I got it tho (retail, Malaysia). Hope this helps!",5
중립,It holds a curl up so ridiculously well! No smudging as mentioned by another poster. But I’m not sure which type I got - it looks clumpy (possibly an application issue as I’m not use to the wand) and does nothing to volumise or lengthen my lashes. I use it more for when I’m wearing falsies or I know I need my lashes to stay up?,2
중립,Ya I use it!!!! Its not dramatic but it definitely works with lengthening and getting mascara on each lash xx,2
중립,"i have short asian lashes and a monolid, it didnt work as well as heroine make for me 💔 it did definitely curl but i don't think the lengthening was as noticeable, and it sort of clumped together my lashes?? which would be cute if you're going for a manga lash separate look but i don't have enough eyelash real estate for that 😭😭",1
긍정,yes and its amazing!!! i dont know how it works but it holds and curl amazingly well and even lengthens a bit,1
긍정,"It's amazing, but definitely buy a mascara remover because without it it is hard to remove.",1
중립,"This >>> 
Dont forget to buy kissme remover as well 🤣",4
긍정,"I love this one as well! It lengthens but looks natural. The brush is the tiniest I’ve ever used and I was skeptical at first, but I’m really happy with the results. And it doesn’t smudge! (Seconding the other person’s comment about needing remover.) This is the first mascara that I’ve bought that I’d buy again.",0
중립,"Yes, it’s a super natural mascara for me",1
중립,"Hmm.. im more into a natural curl look. do u mean the spidery extension/falsies kind of dramatic? Maybe try both Long & Curling + Extra Voluma versions, 1 or 2 coats of each.",3
긍정,"Amazing, thank you!",1
긍정,Thank you for sharing this. I’m impressed that you’ve noticed positive results even without curling the lashes!,2

중립,"I've had my bottle for almost 6 months, if I shake it like a drinkable yogurt it has has the same result as you. I believe the other commenter is correct: there's more space for the liquid to move around and form bubbles.

I usually shake my bottles by simply turning it upside down, holding, then turning back up a few times, without being aggressive with my movement to avoid creating a lot of bubbles. I can't speak to how well this mixes it but it's better than nothing and too much bubbles :)",73
중립,"Less product means more room for bubbles, no? 


Edit: I forgot to ask about how it is. I'm thinking of buying it once my dokdo toner (0/5 btw) runs out. It's between this one and hada labo.",51
중립,"This is normal, when I flip it upside down some foam appears as well at the top. Also this toner is homogeneous so you don’t need to shake it.",11
중립,"i think there’s just more air in the bottle, so more bubbles firm? may i ask why you shake it before applying?",9
중립,I have been using same it does foam after Shaking but settles afterwards…it’s just more space for bubbles ..my new one i opened yesterday don’t have that space so doesn’t foam ..,4
중립,I've gone through about 10 toners of this size and half of them is Naturie. This is normal.,3
중립,What is a skin conditioner?,3
부정,"I finished mine after a year of purchasing it, I didn’t know I’m supposed to shake it? 😭 I think mine didn’t go bad or anything, just used it daily and panned it like a normal product.",1
중립,I just give it one quick shake like flinging something off my wrist rather than aggressively shaking like a yogurt,1
긍정,"Not OP but I started using this recently and it’s a nice lightweight, hydrating toner (I have combination skin). You do need to layer it a few times to see effects but it’s such good value for 500ml that you don’t feel bad about being generous with it. However, I haven’t tried the round lab or hada labo, so maybe someone can give a proper comparison.",14
긍정,"I've used 5 or 6 bottles of the naturie and 4 of the round lab. I decant a small amount of them into a spray bottle each and layer them. I feel like they are the best when they're in a spray. 

I use naturie daily, I have for 3 years. It calms redness, isn't sticky, no fragrance really and is moisturising. 

Some days I'll mist the naturie when it's really hot and then apply sunscreen on top and im good.",7
중립,can you elaborate why you gave it a 0/5?? I was thinking of buying it 🥲,2
긍정,"i hve hada lobo and hatomugi, though i bought hatomugi a little over a week ago. hada lobo is great, especially for keeping your lips hydrated if you pair it with a cream or emollient. hatomugi is alright. its not a miracle so far.",2
중립,"Yeah more room for more bubbles... it's just excessively more than even a few days ago when there was barely a cm more product in the bottle

I like it though I have to layer it 2-3 times. Price per volume is amazing it doesn't feel like a waste like when I used $20 bottles for 150ml",0
긍정,"Good to know, thank you

Just a habit I picked up at some point. As long as it does no damage i see no reason to stop",1
중립,Just a habit. Guess I worried for nothing,2
긍정,"Thank you, that's good to know",2
긍정,Is it really that good?,1
중립,"Skin conditioner hydrates the skin, toner balances skin ph... officially 

Practically, they are the same thing and are interchangeable names

If this is not correct someone will correct me",3
중립,"Seems shaking naturie is unnecessary, just a habit i have. Good to know it won't go bad if I stretch it for a year",1
중립,I see! The motion might still be too snappy/quick so I recommend being a bit more gentle with the motion if the bubbles get annoying,10
중립,"I dislike the round lab one because it feels like plain water and I have to layer so much of it. Seems like this one is the same, but like you mentioned, the size-to-price ratio made me curious. ",6
중립,I’d give it a try. It’s my favorite HG toner. It keeps my pores clear and hydrates very well. It’s my first layer every day.,2
중립,"It may as well be water. I said this in other comments, but I even tasted it (some got on my lip) and it seemed like if you drank the whole bottle, you'd probably be fine. 


That being said, I do have dry skin. I think it's more useful for those who have sensitive skin, but I'm not even sure it balances skin ph.",-1
긍정,"Its consistent for my needs, which is  very basic hydrating and layering product at an affordable price. It is the most non sticky after layers. I dont think you should consider this if you have more needs than that. Tho it is good for layering with other toners.",4
중립,"I’ll be honest, I like getting milky/non transparent toners just so it feels like i’m not putting plain water on my face 😂",9
중립,"I already use the Hatomugi Skin Conditioner, if it's the samey I may as well keep purchasing Hatomugi since it has a better price ratio",2
중립,"I have dry skin in a dry climate. I found it worked better when I layered it 2-3 times. It has sugarcane and protease, two mild exfoliants, so it definitely not just like water. I think for dry skin, the double layer (at least) makes a big difference. 

Coincidentally, it can also clean pretty much anything. I use the leftover toner pad to clean the chrome on the bath fixtures. Gets any kind of stain off. Weird.",6
중립,"That's another reason I became interested in this one. I vowed to never get a thin one again, lol. ",4
긍정,"ooh girl that's why I use the isntree yam root toner lol, it's kind of milky but so lightweight, the placebo is kind of crazy. It's a great toner though",1
긍정,"It is a good price ratio. I never really got into the Hatomugi, but I had the version with alcohol. I’d love to try it without the alcohol in the reformulated version. If I layered it, it made my skin glow, but it also dried it out weirdly.",1
중립,"If you don’t want a thin one, maybe this one is not for you. I would say this one is mostly watery. Maybe the hada labo would be better, as that one has a bit of viscosity.",5
중립,"The Naturie one is so thin, I find it hard to use straight from the bottle. So I decant some into a small spray bottle and use it to spray my face. 

The pro is that it absorbs quickly and layers well. I usually do 2 layers of it, and have tried up to 4 layers before.",3
중립,"Would you suggest it as a bit of a refresher? I find that reapplying moisturizer is a bit too much, but maybe this could work. ",1
긍정,"Hmm, does seem like it could be nice to carry around in a spray bottle as a refresher throughout the day! To be honest, even if it doesn’t work out, at least it won’t break the bank at all hahaha",1
중립,"search about ""Thankyou Farmer rice toner""...i am using it and it's thicker than watery... absorbs nicely and i often use it as a refresher ",1
중립,"True. If it's not enough, I'll just repurpose it. ",1
중립,Search it on Ratzilla,10
중립,"none of them. the new barrier gold is the ""reformulation"" of the OG gold one that everyone raved about but was discontinued. from what i've read on here, it's not remotely the same. the 2nd pic is the essence. last 2 are the newest version of the super moisture UV gel just diff sizes i believe? but they shouldn't have diff ingredients. it's possible whatever site you're on has incorrect or outdated info maybe? i tried searching but couldn't verify if the pump vs cap have diff formulas but didn't find anything saying thats the case. also rec ratzilla as well!",8
긍정,"Uuhh, I love the Skin aqua super moisture gel. And I'm sure that there is no products with the old formula in circulation.

The gold one is said to be thicker compared to the gels, but not overwhelming, I have yet to try this one.

The other three, the 110g and the 140g are the same thing in different packaging, these are said to be gels, well they do feel like a gel moisturizer. The tube, aka the 80g one, the essence is a bit more creamy, also a nice texture.

I love these sunscreens, my HG.",4
중립,"The short answer, unfortunately, is that none of them are the same. I think the Super Barrier Moisture Relief one is the intended ""replacement"" for the gold bottle, but it's different. The old formula, I specifically loved how it was easy to wash off at the end of the day. The new ones are all like ""super waterproof"" and I just don't have the energy for that sometimes!",3
중립,"Ignore size and front names and instead match the exact INCI list and lot code: the older gold gel was usually 110 g with a different filter order, while the 2023 renewal has a tweaked INCI and newer lot codes (23/24+), so ask sellers for clear back-label and cap/neck stamp photos before buying.",1
중립,this. Ratzilla has a whole record of the ingredients and packaging used from previous years in her database.,6
중립,Thanks! I'm not as familiar with asian skincare so I was checking incicode and that wasn't helpful,2
긍정,Thank you!! And yess I looked up the new gold version and people here were not happy with the reformulation. I'll check on ratzilla. Have you used the new uv gel versions?,2
중립,Same same. I use the gold one in summer because I live in a high humidity area but the blue in winter. However this winter I'm switching to the serum so we'll see how thay goes! It finally got cold haha.,1
긍정,"What's your new favourite spf? Also, how different is the replacement in terms of pilling and protection from sunburns? I recently started adapalene so I've been on the hunt for good sunscreens",1
중립,"i have not, no. i was going to get the new 2024 version (white cap) you showed here but i read it would be too shiny for my personal taste. i know others really like it! i think it just depends on what you're looking for and what your skin type is!",2
긍정,"I don’t know what my favorite is anymore. The Beauty of Joseon relief sun: rice + probiotics is nice and feels good on, but I don’t like the shiny appearance. The BoJ Aquafresh version feels great, less shiny, very lightweight, except it can get pilly.

My sunscreen doesn’t have to do a lot of heavy lifting, since I’m absolutely a homebody and don’t go outside much at all (I’m allergic to, like, everything that’s out there). So, I haven’t had any sunburn in over 15 years, but I can’t honestly credit any sunscreens for that.

The new barrier skin aqua whatever also has a shiny finish but doesn’t pill. Does it work to prevent sunburn? Heck if I know!",2
중립,"Is it too basic to just go for the BoJ sunscreen that everyone loves? Not for me (though it's definitely one I'm curious to try) but I don't know a single person who dislikes it. 

Personally, I want to see as many reviews as possible because they don't have a return/refund policy here. I tried the BoJ cleansing balm but it made me breakout even though I've heard nothing but positive reviews for that as well.",1
중립,"Yess as a general rule I don't go outside either since my office is in a basement but the drive there is pretty long and I like to sit outside at times because it gets really humid and unpleasant at work. 

I don't doubt that Japanese/Korean sunscreens prevent sunburn though. I think it's better to have one than to wear no spf which is where I am currently. 

I've seen quite a few people mention disliking a sunscreen because it's shiny, does that happen even if you have makeup on?",1
부정,"i don't think so at all! the HG's are mentioned everywhere and loved for a reason! it just depends what you're looking for i think, yanno? i totally hear you on the return policy. it freaking sucks to waste $$. i have a mini of the BOJ aqua fresh (i knew based on reviews the regular BOJ would be way too heavy for me) and while i don't *hate* it, its not a fav/something i'd repurchase. are you looking for a specific finish or type for your skin?",3
긍정,"You could generally mattify (sp?) with makeup. I don't wear makeup much, though, largely for the same reason I don't like the waterproof sunscreens: I don't want to have to spend extra time removing it and washing my face. I do best with the lowest level of effort! There have been times, unfortunately, when I'll skip the sunscreen because of reasons like it being too much effort to take off, the smell grossing me out (looking at you, American chemical filters), and so on. Or if I can feel it too much on my face. I prefer to feel nothing on my skin so my preferred sunscreens are the ones that don't constantly remind me that there's something there.",1

moisturizer or not, i always let the spf dry 15-20 mins before makeup. you might not need to tho! totally depends on your skin, the spf, the makeup, etc. it's just part of my routine every morning now + less risk of pilling. i bought a tiny (and cheap) rechargeable fan i keep by my vanity so i can help speed up the dry down time too.",2

중립,i started using azelaic acid for pih but holyshit- it helped with decongesting my nose pores so much,87
중립,"Haha you called it already, ilso AND the scraper thingy really made a difference to my sfs. 

Softymo deep cleansing oil did nothing, the ordinary anhydrous salicylic only shrank them slightly but didn't remove them. 

With ilso my pores are almost invisible! I must say though, you really need the scraper. I had huge ccs in all the corners of my nose that no gentle cleansing method or mask could remove. It really needed the physical scraping action to remove them. Yes it does damage the skin barrier a bit but I think after awhile my skins gotten used to it.",55
긍정,"• 2% salicylic acid. Isntree Chestnut BHA 2% works well for me but needs to be used regularly for best results.

• Clay masks. I've tried the ones from Innisfree, Isntree & Skintific and like them well enough.

• Ultrasonic skin spatula/scraper. This is probably the most effective since it gives instant results. There's a bunch of brands that came out with this type of device but the one I'm using is by the brand InFace, which is a Xiaomi sub brand. Inexpensive and does the job.


Regardless of which of those methods I use, the sebaceous filaments will always come back in a couple days, so... I generally don't fuss too much about it",22

It just melts them and using it once a day really helps, no need to massage for minutes or something. I don't really need physical exfoliation now and my makeup sits better on my skin. I don't really hear a lot about this product on western media but from what I see it's very popular in Japan.

긍정,"Spicule product: Skin1004 Matrixyl Boosting Shot Ampoule (with Volufiline)

I'm 37 with sensitive, dry and generally very fussy skin, and I really like the Matrixyl Boosting shot! It's a very gentle prickling if I feel it at all (honestly stung more when patch tested on my hand than what it feels like on my face). Have now used it for a little over a month and a half, and whilst I'm not seeing any real difference for the main reason to why I got it (hollowness under eyes) I definitely notice that my skin feels less dry and more plump after my routine, than when I do not use it. I noticed a difference to my skin pretty much immediately when I started using it, and I had no issues during the introduction, which went pretty fast due to the.. no issues.   
I put it on it every night as my second product after toner, and have no issues pairing it together with my other products like retinal, niacinamide and azelaic acid etc.   


In general my skin has improved during that period and I'm less red, not as dry and not as reactive as I usually am, I have reduced wrinkles and slightly better texture. THAT BEING SAID I'm not sure if that's because of the general ingredients in the ampoule, or because it allows my other skin care products to just work better. Either way, it has become a staple in my routine. When I run out of it I might try the VT Reedle shots to see if I get a different result, but in general I'm very happy with it and am very happy to keep using it!",4

It’s a good serum really. Also contains EGF. I definitely recommend it. It did not feel irritating to me at all. 

To add, I also use tretinoin and have no issues.",0

Looking at them I decided on the 300 dragon's blood and it's on its way, but I'm not 100% sure of how often/ with what other products/ order I'm going to use it yet, so I'm soaking up all the info I can first.",2

중립,"I went all in lol, my skin isn't sensitive at all so I wasn't too worried. I did every other day for the first week and then just started doing pretty much nightly use",4
중립,"I do, I find retinal a lot less irritating than tret, I don't think I would with a more potentially irritating retinoid.",2
긍정,"I've got the cleansing oil which is fine but nothing too special, probably won't repurchase, the Whipping Foam cleanser which I love and immediately tightens pores, the only downside is it stings my eyes a little. I've got the sheet masks as well which are great. 

Mainly I just use the cleanser and the Pore Lifting Ampoule. I do have the Deep shot one as well but I  don't get as much tingly spicule feeling as I do from the VT so I think I just prefer to use the 300 VT with the regular pore lifting ampoule. The ampoule is definitely the star of the line, I can't imagine not having it in my routine, I use it twice a day.",1
중립,"Sure! I generally follow the recommendation on the Reedle shot and apply it to dry cleansed skin  first before anything else, though lately I've been doing a toner or two first and let those dry down, I don't think it matters. I like to apply things in order from thinnest to thickest generally, I think the benefit of applying VT before other things is that they will penetrate more deeply. 

So super simplified, I do rotate some things every other day and play with new products often, but it's been toners/essence -> VT 300 -> Sungboon Editor Green Tomato Ampoule and their EGK Silk Peptide, Dr Jart Barrier repair serum toner, other serums or chemical exfoliation if I feel the need->retinal (non AB, Medik8)-> S nature eye cream->Illyoon ATO Cream",3

I have a similar issue with some unfragranced products where they smell like spit to me. Everyone else describes their scent as neutral and unoffensive, but it's just unbearable to me, so it may have something to do with how our brains interpret certain smells. Or maybe you got a weird batch, who knows!",23
부정,"Mine doesn't smell like that 😭 I've purchased it 3x now and there's always just a very faint soapy smell. I think you may have gotten a bad batch, like you mentioned in another comment. Try the Asian mart, a TJ Maxx if one is near you, or see if you can order it through an online vendor?",14

중립,"Yeeeah i ended up returning it and got the BOJ green plum cleanser - which I like so far. If i really analyze it, I sometimes think I can sense a hint of that smell in this one too, but it's barely there. Must be some ingrwdient that is commonly used that is normally covered up by scent.

That being said neither brands (Cos De BAHA or MaryenB) have acknowledged a relationship between them so I don't know if the Amazon thing is a glitch or something similar.",3

I make a wing on each eye and if I mess it up, wipe it off, and try to draw again, no more pigment comes off the tip. When I make a stroke on the back of my hand going from the base of the brush to the tip, THEN it releases pigment, but still not on the tip.

I've tried cleaning the brush well, storing it tip-down, rinsing it off, shaking before applying, and nothing works. I really like how it looks, stays on, and the method of application, but it's super frustrating to have the pressure of ""gotta get it right first try or no eyeliner today"", especially since I know Heroine is generally considered a really good choice for eyeliner.",2

since upping my tret usage to 4x a week, my previous HG's (pictured) burn my face so bad i had to discontinue use. my only assumption is the citrus/extracts?

desperate to find a chemical/hybrid SPF that's lightweight with a matte/semi matte finish for the days i don't want to wear makeup or powder for oil control. i've *hated* every mineral/physical spf i've ever tried. bonus if it's not $35+ a bottle and doesn't pill.

I just ordered Anessa Mild Sun Milk (pink bottle) and that's otw. I have various others that are unopened that technically fit what I'm looking for, but they contain fragrance/essential oils/extracts or a decent alcohol % which is why I haven't tried them yet.

Finacea has a pretty bare bones ingredients list which makes me think it's really the aza doing all the heavy lifting rather than the overall formula. As far as I'm aware, the ingredient isn't practically unstable. Kisocare has squalane and HA which is pretty nice. But if you're sensitive to botanical extracts, it has bit of that too. There's also a company in Spain (that I can't say because my comment will be smited from the heavens) that makes a popular 15% aza. It's more expensive but a lot of people on sca like it",3

You can still use it at the end of your routine if you want. But your other products before it will act as a buffer. This is actually a desired effect for those who are still getting used to the product and want to make it less irritating",2
긍정,"The madecassoside pads are more for calming and soothing skin than oil control. I recommend trying a niacinamide product. You'll hit the birds with one stone— oil control and brightening/fading PIH. 5% is the sweet spot but higher concentrations like 10% can be suitable for oily skin for oil control (but can also be more irritating so beware). Some products that's might interest you:


- Peach Slices Pore Serum - 5% niacinamide + zinc
- Dr G Niacinamide Booster - 10% niacinamide + zinc + BHA (a chemical exfoliant that can help with oil control and keeping pores clear)
- Be Minimalist Niacinamide - 10% niacinamide + zinc + acetyl glucosamine (another brightening ingredients)
- Cos de Baha has a few different niacinamide products but unsure what's going on with their rebranding/reformulations atm


These are just the ones I could find with zinc, which is also great for oil control and pores but can also be drying. There are a lot of 5% and 10% niacinamide products out there and some with even higher concentration of niacinamide (15% and even 20%!). But I'm not convinced more is better. I suggest starting with a 5% product and bumping up if you feel like that's not enough for you ",2

They're basically nano-bubbles with a substance inside and the idea is that they're so small, they penetrate more deeply than if the ingredient were to be applied to your skin on its own. This product specifically delivers cica this way, not azelaic acid just fyi


I haven't used it but I'm curious to know what percentage of aza is actually in this. I know the bottle says 20 but I don't see any claims that it actually have 20% aza. A lot of products these days slap the total number of actives and derivatives on the label and have a smaller concentration of actual, pure active 


20% aza is kinda high (if it really is a 20% aza product that is. Honestly you might be better off with kisocare who actually claims to have 20% aza or reaching out to VT to confirm concentration if you still want this concentration). Prescription finacea starts at 15% and OTC in the US is limited to 12% just to give you an idea of strength. I'd suggest starting at 10% - 15% first. Nineless and Peach Slices both have a great 10% aza. Purito dropped a new 10% aza too but don't know much about it. Tirtir has a 12% one and kisocare has a 15% and 20% cream ",2
긍정,"Illiyoon ato ceramide cream (though that also has been recently reformulated) and the zeroid soothing cream might be of interest. I's haven't tried the former but it's frequently mentioned here. I'm using the zeroid soothing cream as my nighttime moisturizer and it's been wonderful. Despite the very boring packaging, it's got a nice creamy, cosmetically elegant texture. And zeroid's creams have the golden ratio of ceramides to fatty acids. Just make sure not to get the intensive one because that one has squalane. My only worry is that I'm not sure if it would be too light for you if you're more on the dry side",2
긍정,"Thank you so much. That’s where I’m leaning towards, and honestly I like that the Kisocare has HA and other emollients since regular Finacea can be a bit spicy 🌶️ hehehe, and I have to sandwich it otherwise it sucks. I still have a tube of finacea left but I guess I’ll try Kisocare and if all else fails I’ll return to rx",1

긍정,"This is actually such a god send comment,thank you so much for being so comprehensive!! Especially the part about prescription strength aza and for the options too! I’m a baby when it comes to actives since I’ve stayed away from that from fear of damaging my barrier. I’ll reach out to VT just to ask for curiosity’s sake but will look for smth with less concentration just to be safe",1
긍정,Thank you! I’m going to try the zeroid one!,1
부정,I'm not sure what the conversation rate/factor is of retinYL to retinOL. I personally would stick to retinOL at the very least. Using retinoids that aren't tret is already a guessing game in efficacy. Using a retinoid a step even further away is a waste of money imo if you're already used to retinOL,2
중립,"Gotcha. I'd try a toner with BHA in it then. Maybe something like the Torriden balanceful toner or Beauty of Joseon green plum toner. If you prefer toner pads, there's Celimax's BHA pads, Cosrx one step clear pad, and Needly daily toner pads",1

중립,"Girl this conditioner + shiseido's fino once a week. Gets me a ton of compliments from people. I also live in a VERY windy place and my seriously bleached and box-dyed hair would die of matting in the wind if I didn't use these products. It was a little pricey for me, the conditioner especially, but so, so worth it! One tip I can give about detanging is to do it under the shower. Like let the water hit and run down and run the detangler down simultaneously. The force of the water helps and it doesn't tug as much. Found this out when my bleaches straw-like hair constantly got tangled and would break off in the shower during detangling.",55

긍정,"Thank you! How kind of you. It’s a combination of the light hitting at the right angle and since my hair is very dark (jet black basically), it reflects light better than lighter colours.",39
긍정,"Yeah I was actually pleasantly surprised with how good the conditioner is. I usually used the fino conditioner but it’s hard to get the original one here and this one is cheaper. But it’s so good. I usually detangle with my hair treatment (I use hair mask/treatment every time I wash my hair), the Lador Hydro LPP, another Asian brand.",7

긍정,"Whoah me too! Full East Asian, inexplicable brown hair. It’s probably weird Northern Chinese “barbarian genetics” in my case (lots of Korean, Manchu, Russian/Siberian genetics where my family is from and in our family tree). …On the plus side, does the brown give you that nice coarse-almost-wavy texture? Now that I’ve learned to treat my hair like it’s wavy, not straight, other asian friends are all jelly bc if I just wash it and twist it in a bun, it dries down in big loose waves, even loose princess curls if I use curl cream. One of my friends got a k-perm to get her straight hair to do the same thing. Kids were really mean about it when I was young though… All through childhood, the ONLY thing I wanted was naturally smooth straight heavy black hair like the other asian kids had—no straightener needed! I used to dream of getting keratin treatments lol. But once I started using wavy hair products instead of straight hair products and embraced my natural texture, my beauty life got so much easier :’)

OP your hair looks so dark and gorgeous but our texture actually sounds pretty similar! I might be a little closer to 1C-2A… but it’s trippy for me bc I associate your blue-black raven’s wing color with the “classic asian” dark smooth almost glass-texture hair, not coarse hair like ours. ig Mise en Scène is shooting to the top of my must try list ;) (And if you’re ever in the market for curl cream lol, lmk. Looking at your curlicue ends I suspect our hair behaves very similarly.) 

Glad you shared this post and the cute photo, you could totally be a hair influencer if you wanted! ❤️💕",11
중립,"Wow, same here!! I’ve never met another East Asian with brown hair like mine! I was also envious of my Asian friends and family’s hair growing up too but I like it now. Although mine is dark enough that no one really notices until they look at it up close (hairdressers always comment on it) or if I’m in the sun",2
긍정,"""Barbarian genetics"" actually made me lol because I think it's the same for me! My mom's side is from very North of China. Maybe we're distant cousins...  jk🤣 

>On the plus side, does the brown give you that nice coarse-almost-wavy texture?

Actually my hair is the complete opposite of coarse! It's very very fine (the individual hair strands are very thin), and my hair is wavy. My sister's hair, on the other hand, is coarse, completely straight, and very black. Genetics are fun and interesting.",6
긍정,"Thank you! I had so much fun reading this. You have a knack for writing. I’ve never felt more flattered with such fancy words 

The curly ends are result of a hair iron lol. But you are right, my hair is about 1C. It used to be 2A but for some reason, it’s now at 1C. I think because they’re all the same length and I have a lot of hair, it’s too heavy to form waves. When it’s wet, you can see some light waves. The moment it dries, it’s bone straight. Hence the usage of the hair iron for the curly ends. But when it’s shorter, I saw some waves. 

I actually think the “glass hair” has more to do with hair tone and texture than actual coarseness/fine nature of hair. If you have flatter (as in straight hair) and darker surface, it would just reflect light better. 

I am also so happy to hear you embracing your natural texture. I always believe our hair is at its healthiest and best when we go with the flow instead of working against it. 

As for the hair influencer thing, I do post few stuff to my IG but it’s mainly just for fun and nothing substantial lol",3

I do like the Tirtir Red cushion but it's not my favorite, but remember to skin prep well and use the lightest of layers or it could get cakey.",1
중립,I'm planning to purchase VT Reddle shot. Directions say to use at night. Have you ever used it during the day? If so any problems using it day vs night? TIA.,1
중립,No I’m scared to use it in the morning lol. I apply makeup most days for work. When I use it at night it still feels prickly for a couple hours at least.,1
중립,Thanks for your reply! What strength of Needle shot do you use & how long have you been using it? What changes have you seen? I was surprised to find that Ulta carries it & ordered it earlier today. It's actually on sale too! Will definitely use it at night at least to start. ,1
긍정,"I've been reading about scalp care and think the asian skincare community is on to something. Western countries have never really cared for the skin on our scalps at all.


I'd like to find an AB routine that works with my hair type which is fine, naturally curly, color treated hair. What products would you recommend for scalp care? I think most asian conditioners and oils would be too heavy for my fine hair since they seem to be geared to thick, straight asian hair. I do use a tiny dab of the light version of a popular non-Asian brand hair oil but it has dimethicone in it which I'd love to move away from. But I don't use it on my scalp just the mid length to ends of my hair. I'd appreciate any suggestions for shampoo, conditioner & scalp treatments very much. TIA.",4
중립,My scalp got extremely dry while I was on accutane so I did some research and found the Pyunkang Yul low pH Scalp Shampoo. I’ve since stopped accutane and recently used it and I was astounded at how hydrated my hair was! I used it like a conditioner just for my scalp since I don’t usually put conditioner on my scalp. I did read that a hydrated and healthy scalp can promote hair growth too. I wouldn’t say it is particularly cleansing but I like it as more of a root and scalp conditioner.,3
중립,"I used to live in a very dry climate and the moisture barrier of my scalp was soooo wrecked. my head was always itchy and flaking and I kept wondering if it was severe dandruff. 

I dont really have an AB routine for hair but here are the things that helped. 

castor oil massage and leaving it in for like 30mins before I washed my hair. I’ve heard anecdotally that castor oil is not suitable for every hair type and can cause matting so please do your research. I have typical coarse Asian hair that’s slightly wavy probably a 1c or 2a. castor oil is sticky and messy so I usually only did this once a week.

dandruff shampoo with zinc to help the inflammation. really rub it into your scalp when you’re washing your hair. I used the Cerave one and it worked fine. 

I used the oshima tsubaki oil and massaged it into my scalp when it was fully dry, especially in the areas that tend to itch and flake. A little does go a long way, I didn’t have to use very many drops each time. I like it but it’s also not knocking my socks off either and I’m still looking for potential better alternatives. I also find that it’s way too expensive to buy overseas and I wouldn’t pay double the price for it. I usually hoard a few  bottles when I go back to Asia to see family 😐",4
중립,"I've used the Curel Intensive Moisture Care Scalp Moisture Lotion. it was somewhat soothing to the scalp, but it made my hair so shiny (in a greasy-looking way), and frequent washing irritates it further.",4
중립,My hair is bleached and colored. I’m trying to grow it back out again. I use Dr.groot scalp revitalizing solution hair thickening shampoo and in shower treatment. Tbh I’m not sure if they work but my hairstylist said my hair is better now so maybe?,2
부정,"I dealt with acne of the scalp and really bad dandruff for over a decade. Once I started caring about the skin and not just aggressive treatments, I actually saw results. I put a mugwort toner in a spray bottle and spray my scalp in the am when resetting my curls with water and brush it. I also make a home made hair thickening spray. For hair care, I use Jung Saem Mool herbal zip hair care line with a lot of success. I also use non AB with it. My hair type is ultra fine, high porosity, and irish s curls. Im still battling with hair fallout (hormonal & iron deficiency) but my scalp has never felt so relieved! I tried so many hair care lines from AB brands for yearsss, with no success, until now. Mugwort especially should not be underestimated. Some key things I do is always use a hard water softener filter on my shower, always double cleanse, avoid sulfates and most surfectants, and always massage or wet brush my hair with conditioner in it so it gets to my scalp. I dont deal with oiliness by conditioning my roots due to the formula being compatible for my fine hair.",1
긍정,I could recommend a shampoo and hair treatment. The &honey melty moist line is extremely great for what you're looking for if you have wavy hair. They also have other lines that you could explore according to your needs. For deep nourishment you could try out their deep moist line. I've also tried their oil and it's really good for your hair but I don't know how it works on the scalp.,1
중립,"I’m currently researching more into scalp and hair care myself, so I don’t have much to share yet and that’s precisely why I made this post to hear from those with firsthand experience using Asian products. That said, I have fine, wavy/curly hair too and the Tsubaki hair mask has really helped keep my hair soft and smooth, especially since it tends to tangle easily like most wavy or curly hair. 

Hopefully others can share scalp friendly products that hydrate and protect without weighing hair down. Especially for colour treated hair like yours. :)",3
긍정,"That’s super helpful. Thank you for sharing. :)

I’ve come across the Pyunkang Yul low ph scalp shampoo before but never really heard how it performs. Using it like a scalp conditioner sounds like a great idea for hydration and barrier care. Do you use any other shampoo or products after washing, or just this one?",1
긍정,"Oh, that sounds like quite a journey. I can relate to dealing with a compromised scalp barrier. Thank you for sharing. And I agree, products do turn out expensive when bought overseas, which makes trying out new ones tricky.",2
긍정,"Oh, that’s helpful to know. I haven’t heard many firsthand reviews of the Curel Scalp Lotion but it’s one of the few products that comes to mind for scalp barrier support. The greasy look you mentioned sounds like something to keep in mind. Thank you for sharing. :)",1
긍정,"Thank you for sharing. :) 

I’ll definitely look into its ingredients. Do you use the in shower treatment every day or just after washing your hair?",2
긍정,"Thank you for sharing. &honey’s Melty Moist and Deep Moist lines sound really nourishing. 

Would love to hear if others have tried these or similar products for soothing and strengthening the scalp?",1
긍정,And I've also tried a sample of the tsubaki hair mask and that's also really good and gentle on the hair.,0
중립,Thanks so much for your reply & original post. Do you wear your hair curly? I know a lot of ladies straighten theirs. I do wear my hair curly. When you say smooth do you mean it helps against frizz? Does it have any positive or negative effect on your wave/curl? Some conditioners and masks are too heavy and weigh my hair down as you mentioned or they relax my curl when I want to accentuate it. Hoping others weigh in with their experiences and fave products for scalp care too. Thanks again!,1
중립,I put in a curl cream and hair gel afterward. I use a different shampoo beforehand. Glad it’s helpful!,1
중립,"it really wasn’t too bad, I feel like what soothed my head immediately was definitely the zinc enriched shampoo.

I actually have no idea if the castor oil massage even works I was just desperate because my scalp was so dry and happened to have a bottle I needed to use up. I do it whenever I feel like it now that my scalp feels less dry. Not living in a desert climate anymore also helped. 

The oshima tsubaki oil is the best scalp moisturiser (conditioner?) I have so far, it’s lightweight and doesn’t feel greasy (but don’t use too much 😂) I’m still on the lookout for something that feels even more hydrating but idk what that could be.",3
중립,What do you mean? You should only use it during hair wash days.,1
중립,[deleted],2
중립,"I usually let my hair stay in its natural wavy pattern, I don’t straighten it. And yes, by smooth I meant it helps reduce frizz and keeps my hair soft and manageable without feeling heavy. I do add a leave in after washing and scrunch it in. I don’t use a curl holding gel every time but when I want to style my curls more defined… I’ll go with a curl cream, gel, and sometimes a mousse.",2
긍정,"Makes sense! Glad the zinc shampoo helped soothe your scalp. Sounds like you’ve found some products that really work for you. I’ve heard Curel, Labo H, and Dr Forhair products are good too, but they can get pretty expensive. I’m hoping others can share their experiences with these or similar products so it’s easier to compare and make choices.",2
부정,"Oh, my bad. For some reason I missed out on “in shower” in my head and kept thinking of it as a tonic/ ampoule. 😅",1
긍정,"That’s a good point, I didn’t realize the &honey line was that fragrant. You’re right, it might not be the best fit for a sensitive or compromised scalp. Makes sense that it’s more suited for hair than scalp care. I’ll keep that in mind while shortlisting products, thank you :)",1
중립,Can I ask which leave in and other styling products you use please? I think we have the same hair type! ,1

My one gripe is that a lot of the Asian beauty I use doesn’t feel as fancy & luxurious but they make lots of different options for my very dry, sensitive skin. I like that barrier repair, moisture/plumpness, and skin softness are emphasized in a lot of products so I often use AB beauty for helping with my eczema and rosacea.

So when I found AB is the first time I actually felt like I had choices. Blushes are buildable, completion products are pale enough and cool toned, brow products that suits my skin tone without being too dark and lip products that is also cool toned. For me it was a easy choice",7
긍정,Gentle products and affordable prices! It started with sunscreens and oil cleansers. I could not find anything else that was as nice and affordable as AB products here in Finland.,5
중립,"Not a specific product, but a combination of:

* cruelty free options
* affordable prices
* clearly defined ""solutions"" (like this product it for this skin type, to combat this issue)
* gentle formulations
* beginner friendly 

I started with Cosrx Snail 92 Cream and was fully sold when I took the plunge and got the ma:nyo Pure Cleansing Oil.",4
긍정,"It wasn't so much that AB was so good at first, but when i was paying $54USD for a canadian night moisturizer that did absolutely nothing, and the $14USD Skin1004 moisturizer i was using during the daytime kept me the same amount of moisturized, did I start investigating AB products. 

VT Reedle Shot 100 won me over for real. 

I use a mix of products now, based on ingredients lists and percentage of active ingredients, something AB isn't always forthcoming with (and that's what prevents me from going full AB). But there's no denying that the price is something that has pressured western companies a lot, and has given cheaper western companies (like the ordinary and good molecules) an edge themselves.",4
긍정,"I'm half SE-Asian, and AB products just seem to suit my skin and hair much better. Especially when it came to complexion products and shades, I never had to force them to work for my skin tone, they just did. I think I'm one of the lucky ones who didn't experience any oxidation with tirtir, the shade 23N was perfect. I was always a fan of the cult brands like Hada Labo but once I tried a Korean cushion foundation, I never looked back.",3
중립,"This summer I visited Tokyo, Japan and our guide suggested Koreatown for beauty products. I found brands for sensitive skin and unscented products. I also learned that most had instructions in English on the package.",3
부정,"2 years ago I went through a rough phase where I had face full of acne. Such bad that my actual skin color was almost not visible, only red bumps on the cheeks.

I was trying everything along with of course doctor prescribed medicines. But that’s when I stumbled upon this sub and my life changed since then.

I started with AB101 and now have moved to AB102. I am thankful to this sub and the products.",3
긍정,Seeing Koreans with beautiful skin. I suffered from adult acne and the Some By Mi 30 day miracle toner really helped. I love the rice toners and light creams/sunscreens.,3
긍정,"Sunscreen was my first introduction to AB. It’s undeniably superior. Then I thought if that was so far ahead, maybe other AB products also were 

What I found was excellent quality, innovative products. I also appreciate the different philosophy. Another benefit? The prices are so much more reasonable 

There are western products I love and still use (mostly body care), but my skincare routines are heavily Asian-inspired ❤️",3
중립,Better quality for cheap,3
중립,"High quality for affordable prices. Also I have very sensitive, oily skin and there are a lot of products with no fragrance/ not strong smelling fragrance.",3
긍정,genuinely watching k dramas and seeing how nice everyone’s skin was LMAO,3
긍정,I noticed that I get more for similar prices. But to me good skincare is pricy (in my country or AB),2
긍정,I was a diehard customer for a local brand that does put out great skin products but the prices just kept climbing.  I understood that since they're small and more national than international so I get the whole profit margin thing but I switched to AB for the price.,2
중립,"I moved schools and there was a kbeauty store across the street from my new school. I got curious, walked in, made my first purchase and here I am now lol",2
중립,High end quality at affordable prices!  I am a strictly drugstore makeup and beauty products buyer and AB fits right in for me. 💕,2
중립,"I was on my honeymoon in New York, and we came across an AB store which I dragged my husband into 😆 I got some esfolio masks for like $1 each because the packaging was cute, and they were way better and cheaper than any Western stuff I've tried. That sent me down the rabbit hole of Asian products and ingredients, and I learned that a £4 AB moisturiser does more for me than a £50 Western one ever could!",2
긍정,"Sunscreen was my introduction. I truly thought the Asian Beauty flood was just a nonsense marketing trend. I'd grabbed random skincare at Asian markets and never been impressed (+ I remember it all being rather expensive). I was pretty burnt out on US and EU skincare at the time, jaded I suppose. I'm outside a lot though and *struggled* with sunscreen. I have some sensory stuff so the slime or greasy feeling, having all the dust and debris stick to you really sucked but I delt. But it also burned. 100s of brands and varieties, without exception all would start to make my skin tingle or feel burning, some developing rashes. I was worked out a three sunscreen rotation that kinda kept the reaction at bay. Often avoided any on my face above my cheeks so I wouldn't have red swollen eyes. 


As I was waiting on my sunscreen order from Stylevanna iirc I had added a few random things and looked around. I was at TJ Maxx, then Marshalls, Ross and started seeing the K and J beauty brands (still haven't ran into any Chinese beauty products irl around town). Maybe Asian beauty hasn't taken off here because the clearance section is always full of CorsRX, Skin1004, PrettySkin, Cosnori and more. 


I guess I had good luck because I wasn't completely read up on what ingredients to be looking for and impulsed bought. Everything was mind blowing. My skin loves centella and snail. A couple PrettySkin lotions became body lotions but still not upset- my feet feel amazing lol. The sunscreen was just life changing. I know that sounds dramatic but my husband is even wearing sunscreen daily. I don't dread putting it on and guilt for not or delaying reapplying. It's so easy when it doesn't hurt and cause more skin issues! 


So biggest thing is that everything has worked (or at least not caused issue- I mean some neck/eye creams, anti-aging stuff it's hard to tell so soon). My skin is noticeably better than before. I love the packaging and esthetics. I'm still amazed at the sizes- sunscreen does seem small to me especially if your full body every day, more difficult to find giant bottles like in the US. But the skincare all seems like decent amounts for reasonable prices- although if it disappears from all the local outlets I'm going to have to slow down lol. 


I'm now getting into Asian makeup. First thought was if the skincare is this wonderful the makeup must work well with it. I haven't been wearing any much the past couple years and after decades of full face nearly every day it now looks jarring when I do. My face has also completely changed (90# loss will do that) so needing to update. I really like the enhanced almost enchanted 'natural' look lately which I think works very well with AB products. ",2
중립,Ingredient simplicity and biodegradable packaging!,2
중립,"I am an Asian person living in Canada and decided I’d have better luck buying skincare and makeup formulated for an Asian audience. I haven’t looked back since. 

Also the cost savings. Sephora is expensive. Canadian drug store makeup prices are also pretty high.",2
중립,"I had acne and hyperpigmentation from being 10 years old and tried so many products in my teens and 20s and nothing helped. I gave up and just didnt pay any attention to my skin - convinced nothing worked. 

In my 30s my oily skin became dry/combination skin and I had no choice but to try some skincare routine of some sort. It was worsened by being prescribed tret for my cystic acne.

I tried Snail mucin and reacted quite badly to it. A year later my sister suggested I try some different products and I made my first order on Olive Young and they made a massive difference to my skin texture and problems within a week I was hooked. I never knew your face could feel so soft and balanced.",1
긍정,"Honestly,  snail mucin! I put that on my face one time and I couldn't believe my skin's reaction! It calmed it down and soothed it immediately, and then just seemed to keep improving it! From then on I was hooked! I couldn't believe how much it did and how little it cost! I have used three hundred dollar products that didn't do anything, and that inexpensive bottle of snail mucin did! I know people have issues with it, but my skin loves it. So then I went down the rabbit hole of learning about the different ingredients ( fermented ingredients, rice, etc. ) and fell even more in love! My skin looks ten years younger, people ask me about it all the time! I would never go back!",1
중립,The sunscreen! When I first tried it I couldn’t even feel it on and thought it was a scam/I would end up burnt. Wore it all day in Italy on a boat and didn’t burn at all!,1
중립,"When I tried an Erborian gift set I was gifted, it was so different than anything I have tried from western beauty products and since it is not technically Korean but inspired by Korean beauty I figured why not try to look at other Asian products in general since those that I got in the set seemed to fulfill many things I have been looking for but essentially gave up on since I couldn't encounter them


So far I have been having the same reaction to every Asian beauty product I have tried so far (skincare and haircare). They all seem to possess that *thing* that I always looked for but thought there wasn't enough like-minded buyers to have produced",1
긍정,I have very sensitive skin and it's more affordable. I also have a very sensitive nose. I love products without fragrance but if it's light and doesn't break me out I'm fine. I just think Asian beauty has better formulas than western brands.,1
긍정,Using the sunscreens. They were so good I had to try other things,1
중립,cheaper and works better on my skin!,1
중립,I have oily skin and no western beauty creams fit,1
중립,"i have a very sensitive skin and a very small wallet😂
and once i tried it and saw the results, i couldnt go back",1
중립,I wanted a lightweight sunscreen and AB made me try it ✨,1
중립,Sephora’s free birthday gift of a Laneige overnight mask and lip mask 😆,1
중립,"I have sensitive skin and lots of American skincare is very harsh, it seems like our skincare for sensitive skin is mainly very boring and has no benefit beyond just cleansing and moisturizing. With AB I can get products that are specific to beauty concerns like acne, aging, oil production, but they are all still very gentle. Also, affordability and price per ounce of products",1
중립,"I kept hearing how great it was both online and in person. Once Covid hit, medical grade skin care kept getting more and more expensive. The prices were always bad but it became ridiculous over the last few years. I gave Asian skincare a try and I haven’t looked back since. I live in a very dry climate and it is just so much gentler and nourishing than medical grade skincare. My skin has honestly never looked better. The prices are so reasonable too!!",1
중립,I've developed rosacea and my skin has become very sensitive. I find the gentleness of ab really suits my skin and it's affordable and I can stay consistent with what I use.,1
긍정,"Cheaper, more gentle, great texture",1
긍정,"I love to visit pharmacies when I travel to other countries, to discover new beauty products that I can't find at home or stock up on products that are way cheaper in their country of origin. I went to Hong Kong about fifteen years ago and discovered the world of Asian beauty. I was hooked on sheet masks (which weren't readily available in western countries back then) and also discovered brands like hada labo. I haven't used AB consistently throughout the entire time, as I didn't know how to find them online easily, but now it's so easy to find them online and in stores. I've always preferred to use gentle skincare products outside of my actives (retin A, AHAs, etc), so the AB approach is right up my alley.",1
중립,"1. being Asian and having my skin understood by other Asians

2. having the impression that Japanese and Korean skincare industries pour in lots of meticulous research especially with the beauty standards (i.e. the glass skin thing) and technology in East Asian societies, special focus on traditional skincare wisdom

3. trying to avoid Western conglomerates like L'Oréal, P&G, Unilever etc that aren't ethical

4. the sunscreens just feel so much better",1

긍정,"So far I'm very happy with the Canmake Marshmallow Finishing Powder (not the Abloom one) I was surprised that it really does have a blurring effect LOL I have a loose powder I currently use to set my makeup, but I've been setting my makeup more with the Canmake powder just because it makes my skin look great

It unfortunately does not last as long as I would like it to, but reapplication doesn't feel or seem cakey to me",1

중립,"I am using the toner and cream, it's brightening but it takes time it's not like a shocking overnight difference. That said, I mostly use them because they keep my really dry skin hydrated and moisturized without looking greasy. The sake cream is the only moisturizer I've tried that is thick and occlusive but has a matte finish instead of looking like I put literal oil on my face lol.",52
중립,It’s still quite popular in Japan. A classic.,29
중립,"i use their glossy moist lotion every morning and night, but i don’t think it’s done much for hyperpigmentation. i mostly rely on it for moisture.",17
중립,"I use it primarily for my hair (3c low-porosity) & scalp (very prone to flaking), but usually my body/neck/face also get some",14
중립,yes thats my hg,13
중립,I’m about to buy my third bottle of high moist!,11
긍정,Love my sake toner,8
중립,"It's my holy grail. I have one in shipping. I think I'll use it as long as it's in production. 
I don't use it for hyperpigmentation or brightening, it's super in moisture",10
중립,"Yes I've been using it for nearly a decade, still my hg. And one bottle is relatively cheap and lasts forever. I mostly use it for hydration and not hyperpigmentation though. Tried the glossy moist version as well but doesn't hit the same for me.",10
긍정,"My skin gets so dry from tret. I’ve been using the pink one for about a year and love it! It can get sticky and the smell is a little off putting. I can’t speak to the hyperpigmentation effects, but mineral sunscreen has made the biggest difference in my melasma.",10
긍정,"I love the bright moist for my oily leaning combo skin. Not sure about effectiveness for hyperpigmentation since I use it in combination with other products for dark spots, but definitely really nice and lightweight, good for layering for hydration.",7
긍정,"I love them but like others here, it's the moisture & finish I like (dry skin, hot & humid tropical climate). I feel that vitamin C serums are more effective for mild hyperpigmentation but if it's a big concern for you, you'll get much better results from a dermatologist (creams or lasers).",6
부정,"Breaks me out, smells terrible. No",6
중립,"No on the hyperpigmentation. 

But I’ve gone through more bottles of the high moist lotion than I can count over the years and have a new bottle in my cart. I use it for hydration and overall brightening. When my skin has been through too much of the outdoors, I’ll soak a compressed cotton mask in Kiku at night. Excess goes on my hands and forearms and my skin is noticeably softer and brighter if I use it regularly.",6
긍정,"I have not used mine in a good while now that you mention it. But I still love the underrated and lesser-known kiku essence serum. It makes my skin glow. 

I think I may be done with the Kiku in the big bottle, though. It just doesn’t really do much for my skin. It’s good for my hair though.",7
중립,i threw away half my bottle of high moisture because it was wayyyy too sticky for me and the tiny improvements weren't worth the sticky feeling,5
중립,"My mum has dry skin, and it's her HG for moisture. She prefers it over laneige skin refiner, pyunkang yul and many others.",6
중립,Hey I still like it a lot! So I would say I can't be the only one :D,4
중립,"I do! But not the toners, they break me out.

The essence is my HG though!",3
부정,"No, it smells bad to me. I switched to Reihaku Hatomugi.",3
중립,Yes! I just started using and it am so impressed. I’ve tried 5+ other toners in the last year and none have made an improvement in moisture like this one.,3
중립,Yep almost every day,3
중립,"The original high moist is my ride or die. I usually order 4 bottles a year. I notice a bit of brightening, but it really calms down my redness. I use azelaic acid for exfoliation and brightening. 

Their makeup remover (pink tube) is my absolute favorite cleanser. Technically, it's a first cleanser that you use on dry skin, but I don't need a second one after it with my usual sunscreen and make up. I'm on my 9th tube or something.",3
중립,"As someone who lives in Japan and did buy it based off reviews on this sub, I just feel like it's a relic of the past. Just feels like so much more product and tech has come out. 

The sake smell too was ""fun"" at first but sake is not what I want to smell when getting ready in the morning. I remember I drank too much with coworkers (hot sake is so easy to down), and when I did my drunk skincare and brought out the Kiku, I almost threw up. After that, I don't think i touched it.

My choice of giant jug of toner is the 400ml pump bottle of Hada Labo now.",8
긍정,"i only use the cream because it's so cheap and occlusive and works amazingly for my dry & dehydrated skin. i haven't really noticed any brightening effects (i do have darker skin though so it is harder to brighten dark spots), but it does great at moisturising. im really not a fan of the scent though. altogether it'd be 3.5/5 WRP (only because it's so cheap).",2
중립,It's super sticky so I only use it for arms and legs. It never dried down for me on my face,2
중립,I used the high moist daily until it ran out but I never really felt like it did anything,2
중립,No. Way too sticky. There’s way better products out there.,2
중립,I use high moist but can't say I've noticed much in regards to hyperpigmentation. I use it as body lotion. Sometimes in my fine hair as leave-in.,2
중립,"I still use the pink high moist everyday but mostly just for hydration. If you want to focus on hyperpigmentation, you might need other serums with some kind of brightening actives.",2
중립,"I just got it last week and used it twice on my face, gave me whiteheads. 

So now i’m just using it as a hair mist.",2
중립,"I remember using its toner that’s in big pink bottle back then when K and J beauties weren’t as popular as now. It was so moisturizing, i even used on my body.",2
부정,"Currently using the makeup remover gel and the skin emulsion! Still not clear to me if the lotion and emulsion are intended for body, face, or both, but I use it on my body only for now. 

As for the emulsion, not sure about hyperpigmentation, but I enjoy its texture smoothing and brightening effects. I used to use baby oil after the shower, but this stuff gives me the same effect without the oily layer and the risk of acne. If someone here tells me it can be used on the face, I’ll happily start doing so.

As for the makeup remover, I could take it or leave it. Not sure it does anything tbh. Wanted to buy the cleanser but bought this instead by accident because the name is confusing (my bad).

Definitely want to try basically everything else they make and will continue to repurchase the emulsion.",2
중립,I’m using the sale toner but am thinking of switching to something else as I find it a little bit sticky,1
중립,"I use the High Moist Lotion twice a day and it’s helped a lot with my skin hydration and softness. I just got the cream from YesStyle in the mail today to use as an occlusive to layer over the lotion and the Hada Labo Milky Lotion so hopefully it works out well. I was scared of the scent because of all the comments pointing it out, but the smell dissipates very quickly and I actually like it. Also, the stickiness of the toner only lasted about 3 or 4 days or so for me. I don't know if that's because my skin acclimated to the product or whatever is in the liquid settled to the bottom after being through shipping.",1
긍정,I use the toner as my daily go to. Love the hydration.,1
중립,I use it every day as a toner. Keeps my dry skin from being totally parched.,1
중립,Body toner,1
중립,"Okay that last sentence is making me want to try it, now.",5
긍정,The texture of the cream is my favourite among AB products. I used tret so I always look for intense moisturising products and this feels so good on my skin.,3
중립,"Genuinely curious. What do you think is a replacement for kiku/ why do you think it's a relic of the past?


Here in Canada we have kiku products at our Asian supermarkets and lots of Canadian stores carry them. Like others have said they seem to be a classic. If you ask me when I was first getting into skincare many many years ago I was into hada labo too. But there's a lot of stuff out there that's old but gold. And I know I see a lot of new products or try them that make me think ""meh"" or worse.


Does oversaturation of the Korean skincare market (and availability around the world) have an impact?",10
중립,"Thanks, I already using a lot of products for hyperpigmentation I was just wondering if it would be worthwhile to add Kikumasumune back into the mix for my body considering how cost effective it is ",3
긍정,Follow up: So far the cream is working great. It did give me a couple red bumps under my skin that have quickly gone away so maybe my skin is just adjusting to the new product. I love the texture of it and my skin is very hydrated. I'm going to keep using it!,1
중립,"I wrote a whole thing but I just deleted it because it was rambling.

It just comes down to I bought it, didn't like it because sticky and smelly. My peers 20-30 (in Japan) never bought it, don't really recommend it, but maybe we're just in the wrong age group. Pre-Korean cosmetic super surge during COVID, my friends were using Hada Labo, Chifure, Orbis, etc. Now, it's mostly Kbeauty. 

Replacement for Kiku? Tbh I place little stock in toners. You said Hada Labo is ""meh"", yeah same. I've tried a TON of toners, both kbeauty and jbeauty, and in the end, they're all meh. So if OP is asking about Kiku, my honest opinion is, it's also meh but sticky and smelly. 

OP said they want to target hyperpigmentation, I don't think an 800 yen bottle of Kiku is gonna make that much of a difference. OP should find a toner that suits them (hey, could be Kiku), and focus on actives instead.",6
긍정,If you’re not alergic to any thing in it then it doesn’t hurt to try imo. I usually use it on my whole face (combination skin) and my hands (dry skin) and it’s been a good addition to many of my serum/lotion/cream after that.,2
중립,"Fair enough, everyone is different and sometimes it's exciting to see all the skincare stuff out therre!

Agreed that actives do the heavy lifting",2

중립,"Do you perhaps have a link or name of the listing? I'm thinking of ordering from there too, but there's a couple labeled as fitting the Shu Uemura curlers, so i'm not sure what to go with...",1
긍정,Have you used retinol before? What percentage is it? If it’s your first time then start with 2-3 times a week only at night. It will most likely dry your skin so make sure to use a good moisturizer. Dont use it at the same time as harsh actives and make sure to use SPF during the day,12
긍정,"A good rule of thumb is to always start slow and low for retinol. Start 1x/week at night on dry skin, building up as tolerated. Then 2x/week. Then 3x/week. Use pea-sized amount, follow with moisturizer, and wear SPF daily.",4
중립,"Adding to this - I used this guide when I started using retinoids for the first time and it worked extremely well for me.

https://labmuffin.com/routine-starting-tretinoin-retin-cream/",7
긍정,"I used one time, it was a non AB retinol 0.3%. That was too harsh for me, the quantity was defined in the instructions. As that retinoid was too strong, I researched for weaker and sensitive skin friendly. The one I got says it is ""200 ppm retinal"", which converts to 0.02%. It's quite weak, right?

I used it only twice until now, as the instructions didn't specify quantity I have been using a pea-size amount. Until now I can't really say I see benefits, but I also didn't see my skin getting worse. I'll use it as you say, thank you.",1
긍정,"Ok! Thank you! I felt concerned because most of non-AB retinoids I saw at the drugstore had more complete instructions, specialy because it is a harsh active. This one don't even say to apply it only at night. Even if the product doesn't have so much warning, better safe than sorry, right?",1
중립,Thanks! I'll use this as a guide too! I'm a little bit frustrated that the how to use this product is so generic. Is this something common on AB products? (I'm starting with AB),1
중립,Retinal is actually stronger than retinol so 0.02% retinal would actually be about the strength of 0.1%+ retinol! It’s still less strong than your previous one so you could give it a try but I wouldn’t necessarily call it weak. It’ll take a few weeks to see some improvement but the bigger changes start happening in a couple months with consistent use. Hope this one works better for you!,4
중립,"It's for every product with retinoids because it's them that can wreck havoc if not applied correctly, this goes for western products as well",3
긍정,Thank you! I feel safer now! I'm going to use 3x a week and top it with moisturizer.,2

중립,"Lmao I think I must’ve done it on accident, definitely didn’t mean to mark NSFW",7
중립,Do you have to wash it out every day? That’s my main concern as I only wash my hair weekly,2
중립,I didn’t. I didn’t use a lot so at the end of the day I just brushed it away,2

중립,"By the english test, i'm guessing your tube was made exclusively for the European market which doesn't use the pa+ system.

The UVA in a circle mark is the European standard, which means that the UVA protection is at least a 1/3 of the SPF rating.",99
중립,"SPF = UVB 
PA = UVA

It's not fake! PA is usually used in Korean and Japanese packaging to indicate that the formula has filters for UVA rays (as well as B), the pluses indicate the level of protection (1-4). It's the same formula, just different packaging - they don't make a weaker version of this sunscreen. 

Often times retailers buy from distributors, not always directly from the brand, which can mean you get a variety of batches which can have different packaging. From the customer perspective, this can mean that you can purchase the same (legit) product from a company, but receive different packaging. Out of curiosity, where did you buy this from?",14
중립,"I don’t think it’s fake — it’s probably just the EU version. In Korea, the packaging usually says SPF50+ PA++++, but in Europe they use a different system, so you’ll often just see “UVA” or a “UVA circle” instead.


As long as your tube shows an SPF number (like SPF50 or SPF45) and the ingredients match the official ones, it’s definitely real. Since you got it from a store you trust, it’s likely just a legit export version with slightly different labeling.",2
중립,I think they might tag it in different way. You should look it up online for translation.,1
긍정,Thank you! Any clue whether this is anywhere near as good as a proper pa++++? Do you think I should return this?,4
긍정,"Thank you so much! This really eases my mind. I got this from a korean cosmetics retailer in spain, it’s a small chain and they’ve got a few shops around here. ",2
중립,"TBH the pa+ rating is just as vague.

PA++++ means it's 16 or higher. The UVA in a circle for an SPF 50 is equivalent to a protecton factor of 16.6. So it's probably the same formula.",30
중립,"Then that's likely the case for them, because they're such a big brand it's not easy for small brands to become direct buyers. I wouldn't worry about it - it's perfectly legit :)",2
긍정,Thank you!!!,4
중립,Unfortunately I can’t even log into the EU website right now :/ StyleVana is really making it hard for me to stay a loyal customer,3
중립,"For me on the EU website it shows up in the cart, under where the price is, under where you enter the code if you go a little lower, it lists how many points you have and what gifts there are, the only gift I see rn, is the Abib calming pads for me.

ETA: This is on desktop, can't seem to find it in the app.",2
중립,I'm on the French website and I see it at the bottom of the Vana Reward Club in the profile tab,1
중립,Its getting so frustrating,1
중립,"thanks - it doesn't even shown this on the UK site so I think its missing here. I tried to email them on this and I don't think they understood. 

  
It's so annoying as I've spent so much on Stylevana and it feels like the UK site and some others are an afterthought!",2
중립,Now it disappeared from the EU website aswell. I can't see it on PC nor on phone browser.,1
