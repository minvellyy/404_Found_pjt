1omkc3j,kbeauty,Blush & Lip Shade Recommendations? Suited w/ one another +  my skin tone!,"Hi! I’m looking for suitable blush/lip shades for me. I believe I have light medium, warm leaning olive skin, but I attached two photos of me in different lightings so you can see my exact skin/lip tone.

￼​**TL;DR** - often blushes look ashy on me, or make my skin appear more olive colored than it is. The lip products I’ve tried aren’t nude/usually not “natural” enough for me, plus I haven’t found a blush and lip shade that match one another. I think it’s bc I look for more warm nude rosy browns for lip but a softer, lighter peach/pink for blush (since that’s my natural blush shade). I sometimes peaches and pinks don’t look good on me at all though, so pls recommend any kinds of **colors/shades most suitable for a natural look!**

I believe I have light medium, warm leaning olive skin. 
——————————————-
Here’s my experience with the blush shades I have:

1.	⁠Judydoll glow blush balm: shade 04 spring breeze - my favorite so far, I prefer nude, warm shades, tho it might be a bit “orange”/not peachy-rosy enough for my liking.
2.	⁠Canmake cream cheek: shade 16 Almond Terracotta - I think it suits me…but in some lightings makes my olive skin look more olive/yellowish-green 😭
3.	⁠Judydoll Gradient Blush: shade 02 Peach Cloud - I think this one suits me the best if it weren’t so light. It’s also the most similar to my natural blush color, which is soft, neutral—>warm (?) pink
4.	⁠Red Chamber Haruki Blush: shade Monsia - way too ashy, makes me look kinda bruised and “vampire” like.
5.	⁠Canmake Glow Fleur Cheeks: shade Milky Red - pretty suitable for me, but I prefer but less red and more nude/not as vibrant.

Some lip shades I have:

•	⁠Rom&nd Glasting Color gloss:

1.	⁠Rose Finch - slightly too pink and “colorful” against my skin for my liking.
2.	⁠Deepen Moor - I love it. However it doesn’t match my ideal blush shade and can come off as too deep/darkly colored.
3.	⁠Joocyee Glazed Rouge: shade Frozen Black Tea - too bright, a pop of reddish coral color for me. The advertised color would’ve been a lot better imo.
4.	⁠Nude reju lip gloss: Shade Apple Blended - I love this color when I wear it with my black hoodie, but it can sometimes be too red in a slightly vibrant way.
5.	⁠Judydoll Ice Cool lip essence lip glaze: shade Earl Grey ice - Why. Just why?? The advertised color was near perfection (perhaps but warm) for me but it pulled sooooo orange and bit brownish. Least favorite shade.
———————————————
Anyway, my ideal lip color is one that’s as close to my natural lip color as possible and lines up the best with my skin tone. My ideal blush color would also go really well with my skin tone and be close to my natural blush color (peachy, slightly dusty, neutral soft pink).

The main struggle I’m having is finding lip and blush shades that meet my respective requirements while being similar to/complementing one another.

Thank you for reading, please comment all your shade pairing recommendations!

If you have any suggestions for a moisturizing matte/satin/not glossy finish lip product that doesn’t separate into lip lines, please lmk too!

1omc68l,kbeauty,Desperate to find a foundation/covering cream,"Hi everyone,

(Sorry my english isn't perfect)

I'm 26 and kinda passionate about kbeauty products (more on the skincare products side than makeup side). 

I'm searching for a covering cream or a light foundation to hide redness on my face. I have a sensitive combo skin and many of the foundations i've tried gave me breakouts or greasy/heavy feeling during the day. That's why I think something like a cream would help.
I know it's hard to find covering product that doesn't clog pores but I don't need something that's 100% covering.

What would you recommend ? (I'm going back to Korea for a few weeks next week-end so i can buy those products at Olive young or other flagship stores..)

I’m hunting for a new moisturizer and can’t decide on one because I never found one for day time that I liked 😭😭😭

I do not have particular skin concerns, I just want something hydrating and that may help reducing pores and maybe just unifying my complexion.

In the past, I used:

- Skin1004 Centella moisturizer: Didn’t do much for me tbh… It was nice in summer but as the days got colder it feels like my skin is still dry after.
- Purito B5 Panthenol Re-barrier Cream: I used it at night, it was wonderful!! But many people complain about the new formula 😭
- Axis-Y Heartleaf My Type calming cream: it was alright but same, not much results. 

My evening cream is thick (numbuzin - Nr.2 Cica Ceramide) and it works nicely after retinol or skincare.

What do you recommend?

I have hear many good things about the Purito Dermide Relief cream so I’m tempted to try.

1ohdyjt,kbeauty,What is this?,"
I have these tiny little holes right on my cheeks and I have no idea what they are. I assumed they were due to dryness but I’m not sure! I have been using the medicube pore pads which have seemed to help but I also switched essences  recently and am now using the Aestura Atobarrier hydro essence which my face seems to love. These little indents aren’t anywhere else on my face. Only on my cheeks right in my T-zone. Has anyone else experienced this problem?

Currently my routine is: 

* double cleanse with Beauty of Joseon oil cleanser and Panoxyl
* (sometimes) Centella Madagascar Ampoule -tone with Aúna heart leaf toner pads -Aetobarrier essence
* The Inkey vitamin C serum -Soon Jung 2x barrier intensive cream
* Olay retinol night cream 
* Then in the morning, I just rinse with cold water and apply sunscreen.

I use other things intermittently like poor clearing masks, hydrating masks, collagen masks, AHA/BHA exfoliant, Laneige water sleeping mask (my skin really likes this), and a few other Origins products.

1ob7jza,kbeauty,My Minimum Skincare Routine That Finally Helped My Acne-Prone Skin,"Hi K-Beauty Lovers!  
I’ve struggled with acne-prone, sensitive skin for years. I used to layer on so many products hoping for quick results, but nothing worked long term. Eventually, I realized that when your skin barrier is weak, almost everything causes irritation.  
That’s when I started my **“Minimum Skincare Routine.”**  
It’s not about doing less for the sake of it, but about doing only what’s necessary and cutting out anything that stresses my skin. I stopped trying to add more and focused on removing properly. Even if you don’t wear makeup, cleansing thoroughly is everything. Poor cleansing alone can cause breakouts, and I wish I’d known that sooner.  
Now I’ve finally settled on a minimal, effective routine that keeps my skin calm and clear.

1. **Cleanser – FATION Nosca9 Deep Pore Cleansing Foam** This cleanser was a total game-changer for my sensitive skin. It gives true deep pore cleansing without any irritation, and the soft, rich foam feels incredibly soothing even when my skin is breaking out. I love that it leaves my skin moisturized and fresh instead of tight or dry.
2. **Toner – Anua Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner** It’s super lightweight but surprisingly hydrating, helping my skin feel balanced again after washing. I usually pat in two layers, and it instantly calms any redness or irritation.
3. **Cream – Torriden Dive-In Hyaluronic Acid Soothing Cream** It’s fragrance-free and packed with Panthenol and Hyaluronic Acid, so it keeps moisture locked in all day. I love that it hydrates deeply without feeling heavy or clogging pores.
4. **Sunscreen – Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Airfit Daily Sunscreen** The texture is airy and smooth, almost like a light moisturizer. It blends in easily with no white cast, offers SPF 50+, and gives a natural finish that works even under makeup.

If your skin feels overwhelmed, try giving it a break. You might be surprised how much calmer it gets.

1o7d5kh,kbeauty,How do I get this kind of hair?,"I hope this is allowed here, I didn’t know where else to go. I always see people online talking about wanting tighter, more defined waves and curls. But I’m honestly more into the looser S shaped waves. I can’t find anything online about how to do that. I’ve listed and example of what I mean. My hair already has loose waves but they’re barrel shaped and I’m not sure how to get them to do the s shape? I’d prefer if rather than heat styling I could do something with my wet hair so it lasts longer, because wet styling makes my hair hold that shape a lot better. I see this style mostly in k-beauty spaces. Basically what I like about this hair is that it’s fluffy and voluminous and soft looking, without the Frizz.

I kind of already have this hair but mine always looks so messy, because it is. I just wake up and don’t do anything to it. The day I wash it it looks quite defined and shiny which I don’t like. But as i get further from that day there’s usually a sweet spot for me where my hair starts getting drier and hence fluffier but still holds its shape so it’s not insane. I don’t know I’m just rambling. I’m not really sure how to go about getting voluminous fluffy hair without the frizz yk? And if there’s a way to get my hair to wave in an “s” shape then I’d like that too, as I think it’s very pretty.

Routine: shampoo and conditioner in the shower, let my hair soak through completely with water and exit the shower so that my hair forms bigger clumps. And I let it air dry. No additional products. Occasionally I use sea salt spray but I’m not sure how to use it correctly and I’m not sure if I’m doing it right.

I have thick 2a/2b hair I think. I’d attach a photo of my hair right now if I could attach more than one picture",Top_Negotiation9170,265,0.99,54,1760539919.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7d5kh,https://reddit.com/r/kbeauty/comments/1o7d5kh/how_do_i_get_this_kind_of_hair/

Hello everyone, I hope you are all well.

I'm reaching out because I'd like to know which products you've found to be truly effective (aside from retinol) for treating the first signs of wrinkles and fine lines and firming the skin.

Which serum/cream or mask brightens, moisturizes, firms the skin, and really works for skin in its thirties?

What are your favorite products that have really delivered results?

1omrftv,AsianBeauty,Discovered that I’m sensitive to butylene glycol 🧴,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my experience just in case it might help someone. I once read here on Reddit that someone broke out from butylene glycol. Didn’t think much of it at the time, but for some reason I remembered. 

When I got into Korean skincare, I noticed that almost every time I tried a new product, I’d get small breakouts. Not acne, more like closed comedones or tiny whiteheads on my cheeks and temples (which is not my usual acne area). When I went back to my old routine, they disappeared. I was super bummed because I just couldn’t get the hype… Everyone was discovering amazing products while my skin acted up every time I introduced something new. And then I remembered that post about butylene glycol. Many Korean products seem to have butylene glycol high on the list, while my previous products didn’t. I cut it out completely, and within a week my skin started improving. Seems that I have a sensitivity towards this ingredient that I wasn’t aware of. 

So if you’re dealing with mysterious breakouts, it might be worth checking if you’re sensitive to butylene glycol. It seems to show up a lot more in Korean skincare than in many European brands. I still love Korean skincare, but it just means I have to dig a bit deeper into the ingredient list now hehe 😫",lindathegr3atest,45,0.96,16,1762114147.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1omrftv/discovered_that_im_sensitive_to_butylene_glycol/,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1omrftv/discovered_that_im_sensitive_to_butylene_glycol/

I had previously bought some from EBay and shipped from Korea so decided to have a look and see what options there was that wasn’t buying full price for a smaller bottle at a department store when I visit New York next month.

I’d bought a jumbo size previously but can’t see any available, I can see 2x120ml for £250 or thereabouts but then I see lots of listings for 5ml samples - there are places selling packs of 9 sample sizes for about £15 and I can get 50 of the 5ml size for £150! Is there any reason that this is too good to be true? 

The same sellers seem to sell lots of sample bundles of higher end skincare and all are shipped from Korea so maybe it’s just easier for those businesses to have access to more sample sizes?

1olkyfk,AsianBeauty,Mise En Scene hello bubble primer - review,"Just recently used the Mise En Scene hair primer and wanted to leave a review :]

Before: grown out roots at a level 3 and dye on the ends from January (garnier nutrisse cappuccino colour - not AB) maybe at a level 4?
After: 1 round of primer, I’d say my hair is at a level 6 with orange undertones (just basing it off this specific hair chart) 

Experience: So I did a patch test 48 hours beforehand (based off instructions) which was pretty simple, however since it is bleach my skin did feel a bit uncomfortable but nothing like a chemical burn.  It didn’t smell strongly of chemicals to me, and kinda reminded me of like sherbet candy (sort of pleasant actually). I bought 3 boxes just in case I’d run out but 1 box just barely managed to generously cover my past chest length hair.  Started off at the ends (the heat fron the scalp develops the dye faster, so I left roots for last), application was fairly easy (this was my first time using a bubble formula, and I much prefer it over the liquid). Left on for a few minutes longer than the recommended 30 and washed out. 

Current shampoo and conditioner I use are the Off&Relax moisturise specifically the early grey AND I RECOMMEND IT SM, it makes my hair silky smooth. After washing it off and conditioning I’d say it did feel a tad bit dry-er but it didn’t feel like harsh damage at all, especially after putting the Mise en scene perfect serum on. Despite doing the ends before, my roots still came out a bit lighter, though that’s user error and I’ll be sure to just wait a few minutes before doing my roots for better evenness. 

Overall I’d give it a solid 4.5/5, definitely going to reach for more colours after my hair grows out again. I think my hair lifts quite easily, so results could vary. 

I’m going to go through another round in 5 days and then dye Matt brown a few days after that so I’ll most likely update if anyone is interested :]",Cultural_Ad_9420,123,0.97,4,1761994698.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1olkyfk,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1olkyfk/mise_en_scene_hello_bubble_primer_review/

1oljn31,AsianBeauty,My bath routine : cleasner & washoff pack,"As the weather’s been getting colder, my skin started breaking out a bit, so I decided to change up my bath routine. I’ll be sharing my reviews of the products I’ve used so far. I’m so touched that everyone liked my arm shot. Well, to be honestly, you guys like a shot of the product’s texture, though!

**1. Numbuzin Cleansing Oil** : I bought this because I heard cleansing oils help remove whiteheads. It worked well for me no irritation, and it suited my skin. I also tried using it for a scalp massage before shampooing, and surprisingly, it really worked! Since my skin is a bit irritated these days, I’ve paused using it for now.

**2. Make P:rem Cleansing Milk** : I switched to this after finishing my previous cleansing milk. It’s gentle and non-irritating. It doesn’t remove makeup completely, but since I wash my face with soap after cleansing milk, I’m satisfied with it overall.

**3. powder cleanser** : I bought this after seeing it on youtube. I use it about once a week when my skin feels rough or flaky, and I’m quite happy with the result. It’s a bit bothersome to use, so I don’t reach for it often.

**4. Wash-off Masks** : I always use a wash-off mask once a week. It’s honestly the most important part of my bath time. Here are some of the products I’ve been using, both old favorites and new ones since my skin got irritated recently.

**4-1. Mary & May Cica Wash-off Mask** : I loved the Cica sheet masks from mary&may, so I tried this one too. It feels super soft and it has tiny beads that make your skin feel deeply cleansed. Perfect for sensitive or irritated skin. my main wash off mask is currently this one! def recommend it!

**4-2. Whipped Vegan Pack Scrub** : As the name suggests, it has fine beads that help exfoliate. I used it once a week when my skin was healthy, but I avoid it when my skin feels sensitive.

**4-3. Skinfood Strawberry Mas**k : This one also has small granules like the Whipped pack, so it helps with gentle exfoliation. It’s softer than the Whipped one, but the exfoliating power is mild. I mainly use it when I want that sweet strawberry scent.

**4-4. Skinfood Apricot Mask** : It’s very soft and moisturizing, though it doesn’t make my skin feel super clean. It seems more soothing and calming.

**5. Jojoba Oil** : I heard it’s great for oily skin, so I tried it, but unlike cleansing oil, it doesn’t rinse off easily. If anyone knows a good way to use jojoba oil, please share!

My skin often gets irritated, so I change my skincare routine quite often. It’s a bit of a hassle, but it really helps my skin calm down and recover faster. Since skin regenerates every 28 days, I think using scrub masks once or twice a week (depending on your skin condition) works best. I’m curious if others use cleansing or wash-off masks regularly too. They’ve been helping me a lot, so I’ll keep using them. Please share your own bath routines!

1olb23a,AsianBeauty,Chinese skincare - some thoughts from a visit,"I recently returned from a trip to China, where I looked into local skincare products and cosmetic procedures. Here are some of my observations.

**Drugstores and supermarkets**

Overall, the skincare products in supermarkets and pharmacies were not remarkable or revolutionary. They were similar to those available in other countries, and the choice in many supermarkets was limited.

I was particularly interested in Chinese-made products. I observed a few things about them:

* they were often heavily fragranced
* they came in small bottles
* they were not particularly cheap.

I did notice some unique ingredients. I saw caviar used in skincare lotions, which I had not seen before. One product was also advertised as containing rare earth elements.

Common international brands like CeraVe, Nivea, and L'Oréal were available in some pharmacies and high-end supermarkets, but they were marketed as premium skincare.

The selection of Chinese-made sunscreen was also limited and did not seem innovative, unlike in Japan. Most of the options available were high-quality Japanese brands.

**Luxury market**

China has a growing luxury skincare market. Large malls feature all the major international brands, just as you would find in any other major city. I was surprised to see extensive advertising and retail stalls for SkinCeuticals, an American brand. The products were not any cheaper than in America, but they were very heavily marketed.

**Medicated skincare**

Many dermatological topical medications were available over the counter. I was able to buy Tretinoin (though only in a very small tube) and Adapalene without a prescription. Moderately potent steroid creams were also available. Otherwise, I did not notice any remarkable or unfamiliar medications. I was not focused on exploring traditional Chinese natural medicines.

**Cosmetic procedures**

Demand for cosmetic procedures is growing in major cities, with many clinics offering these services. Cosmetic dermatological treatments were often provided alongside plastic surgery. Skin booster treatments, mesotherapy, and fillers were available. Lifting treatments were also available, but perhaps not to the same extent as in South Korea.

I was interested to see fillers being used as skin boosters. One such product was BIOHYALUX (润百颜), a 2.0mL sodium hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid) solution with lidocaine, produced by 华熙生物科技股份有限公司 (Huaxi Biotechnology Co., Ltd.).

I saw mesotherapy performed with a suction gun, known as a ""water-light"" (水光针) injector. I noted one manufacturer was Bloomage Biotech, and the device made the procedure very comfortable.

For neurotoxins, American (Botox) and German (Xeomin) brands were available, alongside a considerably cheaper Chinese version. I was also very interested to see neurotoxin being used as a skin booster, a procedure known as ""micro-botox"".",Kiwi_In_The_Comments,144,0.93,8,1761958131.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1olb23a/chinese_skincare_some_thoughts_from_a_visit/,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1olb23a/chinese_skincare_some_thoughts_from_a_visit/

1om3wcx,AsianBeauty,Help me AB detectives!,"Two months ago I unwittingly threw away my HG cleanser and I have been suffering ever since. I’m hoping someone here will recognize the details and save me from my unending breakouts. 

The unknown: Where it came from. I am annoyingly unfaithful, and buy from Stylevana, YesStyle, and Olive Young. I also do not always log in to make purchases (WHY) and this cleanser is not in any of my order histories. I tend to buy random things based on reviews or vibes. 

The known: It was a white, milky cleanser in a tall plastic clear pump dispenser, with a black pump. It dispensed as gel, not as foam. There’s copy on the bottle that says you can apply it directly as a first step, or foam in your hands to use as a second step. I still have the pump dispenser and you can see some of the remaining product, it was almost kind of pearlescent. 

In my memory the branding and bottle looked like Pyankang Yul style - simple, pared back black copy on a clear bottle. It is definitely not Pyankung Yul because their foaming cleanser is what set off my current barrier issues.

1okzjan,AsianBeauty,Taiwan & Korea contact lens haul and review,"Product list in order (left to right): OPT (Bega Milk Brown), Largan (Mature), Largan (Fancy), Hapa Kristin (One & Only Grey), Lensme (Blonty Brown)

Picked up a ton of coloured contacts during my recent travels to Taiwan and Korea, and my only regret is not buying more (especially from Taiwan)! As someone who has insanely high myopia + chronically dry, sensitive eyes I've always had to specially order contacts from local optometrists. But I was mad impressed by how Taiwanese and Korean places carry lenses up to -10.00 and how easy it is to buy contacts.

Overall, the Korean lenses were really pretty, but the Taiwanese ones really blew me away in terms of colour choices, comfort, and price point! My only issue that it's a lot less accessible outside of Taiwan (sobs). Everything I got was dailies, and the product list and in-depth reviews are below!

1. OPT travel journal series in Bega Milk Brown (Taiwan) - 4.5/5 ⭐️

Retails for TWD250 / ~USD8 per box (10 lenses), but they always have a promo if you buy 2 boxes. This colour has a very ""foxy"" quality to it, and is noticeable without being too over the top. The lenses were super comfortable; I wore them out for 15 hours, and though my eyes were tired they weren't extremely dry. I rated this a 4 out of 5 because it's not a true everyday lens for me, and you really need makeup to pull this off. But would definitely purchase other colours from OPT!


2. Largan starry series dailies in Mature (Taiwan) - 4/5 ⭐️
Retails for TWD349 / ~USD11.5 per box, but like OPT they were running promos for 2 boxes. The shade ""Mature"" is a warm brown with a hint of pink in the inner rim, and looks super natural. In fact, it's so natural that I barely noticed any difference with my regular eye colour. These lenses are really comfortable, and lasted me 12 hours with no issue. 


3. Largan starry series dailies in Fancy (Taiwan) - 5/5 ⭐️

My absolute favourite lenses out of everything I got. No contest. The comfort and colour are just *chef's kiss*. This is an olive colour with a brown base, and I have no idea how the manufacturer just makes it blend into my eyes. Like you suspect I'm wearing coloured contacts, but can't really be sure of it. This is the product I got multiple backups of even though there were no discounts, and if I run out of this I will be devastated.


4. Hapa Kristin dailies in One & Only Grey (Korea) - 3.5/5 ⭐️

The iconic Wonyoung lenses! This retails for 19000 won / ~USD13 per box (10 pieces). Unfortunately they weren't doing any promos for dailies when I was in Korea. This is a very pretty, everyday lens where the grey in the inner iris almost turns silver when the light hits it a certain way. However this wasn't as comfortable as the Taiwanese lenses; they didn't irritate my eyes, but their presence was a lot more noticeable. Might work better for someone with less sensitive eyes.


5. Lensme in Blonty Brown (Korea) - 3.8/5 ⭐️

This brand was recommended by xiaohongshu, and so I listened. This retails for 19000 won / ~USD13 per box (10 pieces), and the colour is very similar to OPT's Bega Milk Brown, just that this is a touch more noticeable with the darker border. Lensme was more comfortable than Hapa Kristin, but similarly they had a more noticeable presence on the eyes compared to the Taiwanese lenses. Still, I wore this out for 12 hours with no issues. Probably not a go-to brand for me, but I wouldn't mind picking up another colour.


TLDR; Product ranking:
1. Largan dailies in ""Fancy""
2. OPT dailies in ""Bega Milk Brown""
3. Largan dailies in ""Mature""
4. Lensme in ""Blonty Brown""
5. Hapa Kristin in ""One & Only Grey""",blueee24,124,0.99,18,1761928809.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okzjan,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1okzjan/taiwan_korea_contact_lens_haul_and_review/

1oksk0u,AsianBeauty,Never ordering from Yesstyle again,"I've used Yesstyle since 2016, and while the ordering time and customer service was never great, items always arrived. Sometimes they were disappointing, so I limited my purchases to only beauty products. 

In late September I restocked some skincare staples (I only buy the items that claim to ship within 21 hours), and the parcel was marked as shipped on 02 October. Since it usually takes a while for tracking to be updated, I gave it three weeks, but there was no update, no parcel, nothing. After writing to customer service, I received a message that they might take some time to respond, but I received my answer a few days later: the order was not shipped at all, because they needed to verify my address. I wrote back to them four days ago and am still waiting for a reply. 

Meanwhile my moisturizer is running out, I'm debating whether to order it from a different website for now while waiting for Yesstyle to ship my parcel (then wait a few weeks more for delivery to Europe), but I did budget for this order. I'm not really happy about having to spend more money. 

It's ridiculous that they did not ship my parcel for over a month, despite marking it shipped, and mind you, this was all for in-stock products. Now I'm getting all these marketing emails from them telling me to buy their advent calendar, which just make me mad.

1oktxp8,AsianBeauty,"Rom&nd launched (another) new collection, w/ZO Friends (BBK)","Hey just thought if anyone wanted to know I got the email notification earlier this evening from Beauty Box Korea that Rom&nd has a new collection (it's big) w/ZO Friends and there are some new shades across multiple lines and yes I made sure to buy what I wanted first before telling you LOL. I marked as spoilers in case you don't want to know the names or colours. I will discuss/list some that I've ordered/appeal below. Not their liner pots or the Uriage balms either, but a full-on collection.

Highlights for me: 

Glasting Gloss new shades: 19 Joy Berry and 20 Cloud Mint. Um, so a bit basic but glad to have them. Also, a bit annoyed at that Glasting Gloss, given I just recently ordered a similar green colour from their mini Glasting Gloss collection (15 Mugwort Songpyeon). I've not got either yet to compare. Don't forget obligatory 01 Peony Ballet (again) but with a cartoon on it (again).  
  
Glasting Balm: I wish this was some fun grey stuff or colour change stuff but it's just colour mixing I think or maybe a little pH from the grey and then the rest of the other colour (the balms have two colours mixed in) turns them into fairly standard Rom&nd/Korean colours. Too light for my taste but I've ordered them. 19 Pink Jelly (Light sort of Peony Pink) and 20 Daisy Jelly (Coral/Peachy). 

The Juicy Lasting Tint(s):  
05 Bare Fig (repeat)  
29 Joseon Fig (repeat)  
36 Kitten Lychee (cute looking pink lilac)  
37 Guava Daisy (don't even try it Rom&nd. MORE GUAVA? MORE?)  
38 Cloud Berry (Grey. If that stays grey, I'm going to be very happy, even if I dislike TJLT formula and probably just could've dealt w/Black Sesame Jeolpyeon)

The new eye palette looks cute (one is a repeat, 05 Shade & Shadow Garden): 15 Kitten Cloud Garden. This isn't my specialty, I'm the lip person...but I don't rate their formula highly as a Westerner I have 2 palettes and a quad and don't use much, but I sort of wish I got it now...I panic ordered the lips as soon as was notified LOL.

There's 2 highlighters and they look really pretty but if I have another white/icy/silver highlight my Alex Draws will collapse: 01 Cloud White and 02 Paw Pink.

Juicy Roll Cheek has 2 new shades and now I'm annoyed I didn't get 'em too: 08 Kitten Grape and 09 Kitten Daisy. Kitty Daisy is right up my cool-tone alley.

There's Han brow stuff and limited edition Zero Cushion covers too, only in 21 and 23. That's annoying, but also 17 is too dark for me anyway.

I'm a bit Rom&nd fatigued, tbh. I had to buy all their TJLT minis, half of their mini Glasting Glosses 'cos I'm broke, then the other half (still coming from BBK), all 3 of the Volume Hack kits a few months ago, I feel like Tanning whatever collection wasn't all that long ago either, 13 Guava Cream and 14 Muige in full size Glasting Gloss (it's nice tho), 10 Shell Brown in their Lip Liner and the 2 Uriage Balm collabs (Barrier Grape, Juju Barrier). Now this. It's a big collection. Lucky I'm just a lip person with them mostly now.

1okmc9n,AsianBeauty,[Review] Beplain Cicaterol Ampoule - my skin barrier is stable,"**\*\* I can finally post on Asian Beauty!!!** 

Hi everyone! Today I wanted to share one of my absolute favorite calming products. I first discovered this through a Youtuber I follow, but I was already pretty familiar with Beplain as a brand since I've been using their foam and cleansing oil for a while! After trying this ampoule for myself, I can confidently say - it's amazing!

I'm already on my second bottle and heading into month 3, so I figured it's time to give it a proper review.

I have super tricky skin - seborrheic dermatitis, gets overheated easily, sensitive + combo skin that flips out once a month like clockwork. Since I started using this ampoule, I barely get those ""skin freakout"" episodes anymore.

The biggest change is that it feels like I actually have a skin barrier now. My.face feels soft even before and after washing (never felt that before!) and I get way fewer breakouts.

Even though I use a few things, this ampoule is the MVP - It's the one thing I feel really made my skin calmer and stronger.

Also, the instant calming effect is real - redness literally disappears within a few minutes of applying. No irritation, no stinging, just soothing. Works for all seasons and doesn't feel heavy on my oily T-zone.

I actually bought it during an Olive Young sale. I mostly use it on my forehead where I break out the most, and it noticeably flattens angry spots overnight!

1okqpil,AsianBeauty,can i just use the product straight from the refill pouch?,"Hello, new here! I've been looking for a lightweight moisturizer to switch out my current really thick one and I've decided to go back to an old moisturizer I used to use. It comes in a 50ml airless pump jar, the refills are plastic pouches with a screw cap, and I still have an old empty jar in my possession. That being said there are parts of an airless pump jar that are basically uncleanable right, and overtime product can build up in those books and crannies. 

I've read that you shouldn't refill the main packaging forever, but that leads me to wonder why I/we should buy the main packaging at all??? The refill pouch says it's good to use up to a year after opening too. I know the jar is sturdier and prettier but is there any actual downside to just squeezing out the moisturizer from the pouch, no jar?

1ojpm1e,AsianBeauty,“Minimalist” skincare: how do you build your routine?,"So I have seen Dermatologists on on instagram and I have seen the following general recommendations for a routine:

- vitamin C
- optional: lotion
- sunscreen

PM:
- cleanse
- retinoid
- lotion

Optional:
- all sorts of things from hyaluronic acid to niacinimide to azelaic acid

I know the obvious answer is “do what your skin needs” BUT how do you structure your routines? How do you do the research to know what works (vs is a trend or a new-ish thing like PDRN) and pick products to try?

1ojidn1,AsianBeauty,Swatch and review- Clio Crystal glam tint in 04 pale plum,"Reviewing and swatching Clio Crystal glam tint on medium neutral muted olive skin in indoor lighting. 

The official website described the shade as a cool toned plum shade and it's pretty accurate. It's an everyday wearable colour for my two toned lips. 

The formula smooth, non sticky and glossy. Doesn't leave my lips dry and the tint last a good amount of time even with eating and drinking. It's easy to reapply or apply multiple layers of this tint as well.

 +1 for the applicator as well as it's not an unpleasant user experience as well! Doens't have a strong fragrance either.

One of my favourites and most used lip products and will repurchase this as long as they make it. 10/10 recommended! ",AcronymTheSlayer,53,0.94,4,1761776146.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojidn1,https://reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1ojidn1/swatch_and_review_clio_crystal_glam_tint_in_04/

Our weekly product authenticity thread is a work in progress, comments about how to improve are welcome. We made our best effort [based on comments received here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1brprqo/firstever_product_authenticity_thread/) as well as what we have been seeing as mods.

We would like to note that product packaging AND formulas may vary by country of sale and date of manufacture. This might include anything about the formula. Our goal is to make it easier for folks to compare such things, and to confirm or assuage concerns about their products.

Please post any photos or experiences you have around your AB products, while adhering to our other subreddit rules.

Make sure you state where you purchased your products from. If you bought from a 3rd party of a major retailer, you can say for example, 'eBay/amazon/taobao seller' instead of sharing the specific name, if you prefer.

To help you get more responses, consider including:

* Photos of confirmed authentic products as comparison, requests for authentic products are allowed
* Your purchase date, product manufacture date, or any expiration dates
* Country you bought the item from
* Whether your product had to be shipped to you (shipping conditions can compromise product stability)
* How much you paid for your product

1oifluq,AsianBeauty,Are you guys still buying romand's lip products after their controversy or waiting for the reformulation in 2026?,"just what the title says! I've seen some people saying the dewyful water tint was the major culprit, and other people saying all their lip products gave them reactions. if I'm not wrong, rom&nd said they'll launch a project zero in 2026 and rerelease their shades in a new formula, but until then, are you guys still buying their lip products, or staying away from them until the new formula is out?  


**for context, since people are asking:** romand reported a 300x spike in complaints about irritation, dryness and cheilitis since may 2025, this year. apparently, i was mistaken and the formula people complained about the most was the juicy lasting tint (sorry, got that dewyful info from my friend!!)  
  
they have since refunded people who had such reactions and have run tests, and there have been complaints about dyes such as red 202 and red 201 (but those are also common dyes used in many lip products), as well as a fast evaporating solvent. because of that, rom&nd posted a project zero, both on their official instagram and website: [https://romand.co.kr/article/이벤트/13/180057](https://romand.co.kr/article/이벤트/13/180057)

Trying to get back into skincare and recently bought the Round Lab Dokodo foam cleanser after reading good things about it! So far so good... except the smell. Each time I've used it, all I can think of is how insane it is that it literally smells like  puke. 😭😭😭

I know I have a pretty sensitive nose, but I saw a few people online saying they experienced the same. I got mine from target, so I may try returning it and getting another one from this new asian mart that opened nearby, but idk if I should do that or just try something else completely. 

About me:
31F, I think i have combination skin - forehead and chin can sometimes get a little dry, while t zone has larger pores. Used to only have acne here and there, but suddenly had a lot on my chin and forehead since the spring. I think this was mainly tied to my nexplanon - which i removed a few months ago - as things have gotten a lot better, but not completely. Do have a little eczema and such too (but not on my face).

Had been using just water to wash my face and the AHC Hyaluronic toner mornings and night for a bit. Added in the cleanser 2 nights ago and the Round Lab Birch Juice moisturizing cream 4 nights ago. Face is def already softer and pores look a bit smaller too!

1ogm5z7,AsianBeauty,Mise en Scene perfect serum super rich conditioner: a review,"Mise en Scene, I was not familiar with your game because this is such a great conditioner. 

As the weather is getting dryer and colder, I wanted something for my hair to avoid it getting too dry and tangly. I didn’t realise how good it was until I used it on its own (without layering any oil or post-wash product). My hair was so soft and shiny! 

The smell is nice but not overwhelming. I also like the fact that it’s more readily available and affordable where I live. 

The consistency is a bit too runny for my liking but it does work. I just don’t think it’s good for detangling in the shower because I prefer something thicker to avoid snagging on my hair.

1oh38tp,AsianBeauty,[News] Notable New Olive Young Online Launches & Brand Updates - 3rd Week of October,"Hello, everyone! I hope you've all had a lovely week.

It's getting noticeably colder here in Korea - how's the weather where you are?

As we move toward winter, sunscreen purchases tend to slow down, while demand for lip balms, hand creams, and deep moisturizers typically increases. I'm curious to see if that pattern holds again this season.

\[Personal Insights\]

* This week, there were only two new sunscreen launches, which aligns with seasonal shift away from sun care.
* We're seeing greater formula diversity in anti-aging, especially around next-generation retinoids. 
* HPR, in particular, is becoming more common in new launches, offering strong anti-aging benefits with lower irritation.
* ""Transforming textures"" - products that change form during application - continue to be popular. 
* The at-home skincare/home-beauty market remains strong, with many consumers looking for professional - level results at home, which also explains the increase in treatment -style cleansers and intensive boosting serums. 

\*\* HPR is a next-generation retinoid, sometimes recognized under the trade name Granactive Retinoid. Unlike traditional retinol, which must undergo multiple conversions steps in the skin, HPR binds directly to retinoic acid receptors strength tretinoin. Research suggests HPR can help reduce the appearance of fine lines, discoloration, and uneven tone, making it a string option for those who want high performance results with lower irritation risk.

1oguicb,AsianBeauty,Scalp Barrier Repair: Gentle Products and Routines,"Hi AB community!

I’ve been thinking about scalp barrier health lately and wanted to start a discussion about it.

Based on what I’ve read, just like our facial skin, the scalp can get dehydrated or damaged too especially after overuse of harsh shampoos, strong surfactants, or exfoliating acids. This can lead to flakiness, irritation and hair that gets oily faster. 

Sometimes a damaged scalp is mistaken for dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis and using strong exfoliants or harsh treatments meant to ‘clarify’ it can make things worse.

I thought it would be interesting to discuss products formulated for scalp barrier repair particularly those that are gentle, suitable for daily use, and avoid AHA/BHA (glycolic, lactic, salicylic acid) and strong surfactants, though PHAs are generally gentler.

This could include shampoos, serums, tonics, oils, or barrier friendly lotions/creams (like Curel) designed for the scalp. 

Would also love to discuss barrier supportive routines and how people incorporate barrier friendly, soothing, and hydrating products into their scalp care, even if not used daily.

I tried replacing it with a Shiseido pad cut in half, but this didn't work too well. The pad was a TINY bit too thin, and after a couple curls, the metal top clamp would start hitting the front of the pad, instead of the top, and when i'd open the clamp it would pick up the entire pad. 

I can't seem to find a replacement pad specifically made for this curler. Does anyone else use this curler, and if you've had to replace the little pad, what did you use?
