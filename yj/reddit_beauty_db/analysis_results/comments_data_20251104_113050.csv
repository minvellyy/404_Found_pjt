nmml3mk,1olxqvi,kbeauty,NatsukiSings,"Hi! For starters, I have combination skin, thin, prone to dehydration and sensitive. Also, I HATE the feeling of creams on my face, so I always look for light finishes.

I love the Purito Deep Sea Pure Water cream, but the've changed the packaging and, I guess, the formula too. I don't know about the new one. The old one feels light, soft, almost fake, like it's not gonna hydrate. But it does. You just need a bit, like a pea or two for the whole face and it gets absorbed like a charm. And the hydration lasts. It has niacinamide and panthenol and its soothing, so it calms my skins redness. 10/10. Gonna pray they haven't changed the formula.  
The Centella Unscented Recovery cream is also a favourite of mine, mostly during winter, when the Deep Sea one is not enough (in summer the Centella one is too heavy as I live in a VERY humid place). It's a must for sensitive skins or damaged skin barriers. During summer, if my skin gets burned, I use this and the burn heals super fast. Love it. But they've changed the packaging too T\_T  
The Dermide Relief cream is a bit too thick for my liking as a daily moisturizer, but a great help when a specific spot on my face is specially dry or sensitive or when I wanna make a cream/serum more heavy (for ex, if the climate changes for a few days and it gets very dry).   
I also used Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream and I liked it very much. You can modulate how heavy or light it feels because you can apply more than one layer and it still gets absorbed (unlike Purito's Centella or Dermide Relief, or other creams I've tried, that you put more on your face and just.....sit there, pilling on top of each other). Purito's Deep Sea (old version) is like this too. It's gonna be my salvation if the Deep Sea has changed :\_)  
I also have Purito's Oat In Calming cream but, AGAIN, they've changed the formula. But I've heard great things about the gel version. I've heard it has the best of the cream and it's lighter, so........... Imma buy it soon xD

The Deep Sea would be my top recommendation. With it's formula, it helps with hyperpigmentation and uneven skintone, inflamation and hydration. It should still be a great hydrating cream. If not, the Klairs is great, but only for hydration.",1,1762044811.0,Best Korean day moisturisers of 2025?

nmtt3d5,1ojib0a,kbeauty,pixi3strawb_,"Hi! So a few days ago I received my erborian bb cream and did a wear test from 11 am until 8 pm! I would say that the bb cream is not bad, i think i just got a bit hesitant because the shade is bit lighter than me (i got the nude one because it’s the darkest that i could find) upon application i think it’s a bit overwhelming for me because it’s kinda thicker than the missha one but it’s still manageable as long as u apply them thinly! But on the other side, i got a small acne on my left cheek after using it but tbh idk if it’s really caused by the erborian cream (i did not experienced this with missha when i first tried it) 

For the overall experience, i would say that it’s the same with the missha one! I think it has a sheer to buildable coverage, and in my case, i only applied a thin layer to even out my skin and because the shade is a bit lighter for me. It doesn’t feel heavy on the skin as well and did not peeled off (this might depend on your skin prep) 

If you have a fair complexion and you have a budget, you can opt for the erborian one, I only got the 5ml and it’s already pricey for its size lol.

this is my routine rn, my skin hasn't felt dry since i started on this routine. i've checked the ingredients on folliculitis.


- [TirTir Milk Skin Toner](https://tirtir.global/collections/skincare/products/milk-skin-toner): it makes a huge difference in terms of moisture, the only time my skin looked crusty was when i ran out of it 

- [Hado Labo Lotion Super Hydrator](https://hadalabotokyo.shop/products/hada-labo-tokyo-super-hyaluronic-acid-super-hydrator-lotion-for-age-18-39-150-ml-bottle-pack-of-1): i use this every day AM and PM after the toner/any actives to lock in everything. it 100% helps my skin retain any moisture but it doesn't do much just on its own

- [Cosrx Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/snail-mucin/products/advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence): heard it breaks some people out, hasn't done it to me tho. nice for an extra kick of moisture. it's super gentle, it was one of the only products that didn't make my face feel like it was on fire when i first started using benzoyl peroxide

- [Beauty of Joseph Rice + Probiotics Suncream](https://beautyofjoseon.com/products/relief-sun-rice-probiotics?_gl=1*fdralv*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvJHIBhCgARIsAEQnWlCdnlMB0wxQmL_NGNdTKNZwzHPvxRXM59_-EAVczdkyZy9Ap-e8GeIaArrXEALw_wcB&gbraid=0AAAAAp9LuYQ4ifStx8wbrUcbxCuSBza65&variant=43264254476453): it has ONE ingredient that gets flagged by folliculitis scout, but it was hard finding a suncream that was completely FAS (and available in ireland). i did use this [Boots](https://BootsSPF+InvisibleFaceDailySuncareFaceFluidSPF5050mlhttps://www.boots.ie/boots-spfand-invisible-face-daily-suncare-face-fluid-spf50-50ml-10344819) brand one which is FAS, but it would pill so badly and felt so thick. [this](https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-products-malassezia-pityrosporum-folliculitis/) website has a massive list of FAS products, but i would double check everything on the folliculitis scout ingredient checker


i also tried these two moisturisers before settling on this routine:


- [La Roche Posay Toleraine Sensitive Fluide](https://www.laroche-posay.co.uk/en_GB/toleriane-sensitive-fluid-moisturiser/LRP_914.html): it only has 11 ingredients but one layer is barely moisturising, and the price for the amount of product makes it not worth layering

- [Uriage Bariederm-Cica Daily Gel](https://www.uriage.com/AA/en/products/bariederm-cica-daily-gel-cream) it was definitely more moisturising than the la roche posay cream, but it left a weird film on the face that i didn't like",1,1761908428.0,RICH MOISTURIZING PRODUCTS FOR FUNGAL ACNE PRONE SKIN?

- angel’s liquid bha exfoliating body wash is my holy grail. i’ve gone through so many bottles and i can definitely see a difference in my skin. for context, i have keratosis pilaris so my arms are uneven in color and i definitely have seen more evenness in my skin and decrease of bumps. if you don’t have kp, i think you’ll see even faster results.

- cocoon an giang palmyra palm sugar body polish. i promise you that this will be a different experience than any other body scrub because it not only exfoliates but makes your skin SO soft and dewy after. i’ve tried so many body scrubs and usually think they’re often too drying. only con is if you’re sensitive to smell you might think it’s too strong, but i personally love the smell and after you wash it off there is a very small skin scent trail. the smell to me is like sweet ginger no bitterness at all. 

- medicube body peeling shot. honestly this is extremely affective, but i hate the smell and often times find myself avoiding using it due to the smell, even though i like the results.",3,1761759750.0,Kbeauty body care suggestions

Felt the obvious prickly sensation on the first time, thereafter I don't feel them that much because I got used to it  I guess? Idk. Everyone on here seems to be saying how uncomfortable their 1st experiences on VT Reedle 100 with some saying it hurt so much that they didn't continue.

So in my book, VT Cosmetics is the frontrunner of this spicules thing and they are sort of the benchmark to compare all other comapnies' spicules products. Since my first experience was with Isntree, and it was pretty mild, I thought the VT 100 would be a step up for me -- at the point I was thinking maybe the Isntree is only comparable to VT 50 perhaps in terms of sensation.

I just tried my first VT 100 a couple of days ago and I thought THAT was even milder than the Isntree? I hardly felt anything at all. So that was a surprise for me. I also have the 300 sample so I'll try that maybe in several days' time see how it feels.

In terms of effects and benefits on my skin, I can't really tell. My most problematic issue is my melasma. I'm hoping by using spicules, it would help anti tyrosinase inhibitors work much better, but melasma is a tricky thing if it's hormonal as even if the epidermal and dermal layers are being treated, the problem will still persist if systemically the hormones are doing the devil's work non-stop lol",1,1761892165.0,Experiences with Spicules

With retinoids, you want to make sure you're wearing SPF daily, not just the day after. Start with a small amount once a week (PM only) and slowly increase the frequency as tolerated. With retinoids, frequency and consistency is key. You want to use the highest concentration your skin can handle daily rather than a super high strength one infrequently. Retinoids are best on dry skin after cleansing and before the rest of your routine. But if that's still too irritating for you, you can use it with/after your moisturizer to buffer it until you can tolerate it better


That all said, retinAL is a very unstable ingredient. So without a good formulation, the retinAL will lose strength and won't be effective. And looking at that ingredients list... I really wonder whether it's a stable formula",3,1761542210.0,How to use retinol AB

nllvlhe,1ogz2ai,kbeauty,AliceKaminski,Oh thanks. I went to check if the product had the same composition as I saw in sites. This collection releases so many similar products it's a little difficult to me to make sure I got the right one,2,1761545588.0,How to use retinol AB
nlsb26r,1ogz2ai,kbeauty,RadiantStarr,"Botanical extracts and essential oils can be irritating, especially citrus oils (they're even photosensitizing to an extent). Some people have more sensitive skin than others and can't tolerate them at all. Some are fine with them. The presence of botanical extracts isn't a deal breaker imo. But the amount, variety, and types in this particular product is *exceedingly* unnecessary. So much so that it makes me instantly doubt that this product is formulated well and turns me off from the entire brand. It feels like they don't know what they're doing 


I don't have a specific recommendation because I haven't really tried any. My skin is very sensitive to actives. I just cracked open the Iope super bounce serum (0.015% retinOL, super low) and I already have to be careful with it damaging my moisture barrier haha... 


I suggest looking at products from well known brands and produced by a reputable manufacturer (Kolmar, Cosmax, etc). You want a product that comes in opaque, air-tight packaging (no dropper bottles). Also do you due diligence and make sure the products actually have the % of pure retinOL or retinAL that they claim. There are many that actually have a lower percentage but use the total concentration of derivatives on the label to draw in consumers. I've personally landed on Iope after a lot of research and for a multitude of reasons. But there are quite a few Korean retinoids on the market now",2,1761632993.0,How to use retinol AB

I read that AB retinoids are less sensitizing and searched for one that I saw good reviews. But I was confused by the lack of instructions, since I know retinoids are something to use carefully.

I didn't want to bother you, I'm grateful for your help. I didn't know the full list of ingredients is so important, I was only thinking about the lack of instructions. I'm really new into AB and I never used retinoid until 3 months ago.

Steps to verify a JMsolution product using the QR code

Locate the QR code: Find the QR code on the product's packaging.

Scan the code: Use your smartphone's camera or a QR code scanning app to scan it.

Go to the verification page: The scan will direct you to an official JMsolution verification website.

Confirm authenticity: On the website, check the displayed information to confirm the product is genuine. Look for a red ""genuine"" word, a product code, and a scanned count. 

Alternative verification method (magnet card)

Some JMsolution products include a magnet card.

To use this method, place the magnet card near the upper right corner of the mask's verification area on the packaging.

This would not be enough for me in the winter. Since you're asking specifically about winter, I'm going to guess you might have dry skin in the winter? I have a similar issue (but I also have rosacea, which makes my skin barrier challenging).

In my opinion, a good winter skin routine is something like this:

1. Wash

2. First essence (something like Mixsoon Bean Essence or ma:nyo bifida biome toner)

3. A milky toner that's a bit richer (maybe Purito Oat In Silky Toner or Tirtir milk toner)

4. Moisturizer (I really like Skin1004 Enrich Cream)

At night, a thin occlusive on top to keep water from evaporating from your skin overnight. Something like Abib Rice Probiotics Overnight Masks is really good.

However, I would caution you against getting anything you put on your body (like cosmetics and skincare) or anything you ingest off Amazon. Amazon warehouses often store all products of a kind together, regardless of the seller.

nkuvvod,1ocdhli,kbeauty,yearofdjn,"For a quick solution, go to [Anua’s official website](https://anua.com/products/niacinamide-10-txa-4-serum-2), and download or screenshot a picture of the bottle front and back. If they don’t have a picture of the back, the front should be enough. Fake brands have to alter labels, images, and text on the bottle to avoid being sued. Look at your bottle, and zoom in on the screenshots, comparing both. If everything is exactly the same, you have an authentic product. If there are any differences, even as subtle as a dot somewhere that does not appear on the bottle in the screenshot, then it is fake, and you should return it ASAP.

To avoid this in the future, when shopping for skincare on Amazon, look under the “Add the cart”, and “buy now” buttons. You will see some information that includes; ships from, sold by, returns, gift options. Make sure that it is SOLD BY the brand itself, or says something like “Anua official”. Not something crazy like “fjtieaodytnyogisbwyeignri” or “Jane’s Lane”, regardless of the seller’s ratings. Many brands will also have a link on their website that lists verified retailers. If Amazon is not included, I would look elsewhere.

I know it is tempting, especially when there are deals on Amazon you don’t see otherwise, but spending the money on an authentic product is absolutely 110% worth saving yourself from unknown, potentially harmful impurities in fake products. Even if this serum is authentic, I would not risk buying from that store again. The next serum might be fake.

I used to buy VT Cos Reedle Shots from Amazon, I have purchased at least 7 bottles. One of those bottles arrived totally empty, another came broken and would not pump, and a third was fake. That’s when I quit buying skincare from Amazon entirely.

If you are still tempted, go on social media and search “reaction fake skincare”. That should change your mind. 🥰",1,1761171122.0,Is my Anua serum fake?

nk3fcmw,1o9ksrt,kbeauty,Unfair_Finger5531,"Just quickly: Glass skin can be achieved easily by layering humectants (toners, essences, and serums) heavily and sealing them in with a glossy moisturizer (or non-matte moisturizer). Mists sprayed over the whole thing when you’re done can help even more. The key is layering the humectants first until your skin looks dewy. 

That’s a cosmetic approach to the glass-skin look. But a more holistic and natural approach is to get your skin barrier in tip-top shape. When your barrier is in good shape, your skin will have a natural bounce and elasticity, which will make it look soft and dewy.

For both approaches, it is helpful to add ferments to the list of humectants. Ferments make your skin glow if you layer them. Missha 5x revolution, benton fermentation essence, and mixsoon galactomyces are all glow-makers. The glow will heighten the glass-skin effect, and ferments are generally good for skin conditioning in general. 

I made of list of glowy products a while back, maybe it will help: https://www.reddit.com/r/PeptidesProducts/s/FDr3Yccrtf",1,1760763709.0,"32F, dry skin, product recommendations"
nka310l,1o9ksrt,kbeauty,CatCold7629,"Since your skin leans very dry and gets flaky in winter, I’d start with barrier-focused hydration before layering anything too active. A lot of people jump into K-beauty essences or toners, but what actually helps long term is replenishing the lipid balance. Look for oils or serums that combine squalane, moringa, borage, or marula — these mimic the skin’s natural sebum and deeply hydrate without heaviness.

I formulate small-batch skincare myself, and the biggest mistake I see is skipping nourishment for the barrier. When you give the skin the right fatty acids and antioxidants, it naturally starts to look like “glass skin” because it’s balanced — not because it’s coated in layers. Try introducing one nourishing oil under your moisturizer at night and you’ll probably see smoother texture within a week.",1,1760864908.0,"32F, dry skin, product recommendations"

njvnfrr,1o6uefx,kbeauty,MordredsChild,"Hey there! If you've been wearing classic ivory, you're probably a pale girlie like me, and I can recommend TirTir's red cusion in shades between 10c shell and 17c porcelain. It just depends how pale you are/whether your undertone is cool, neutral, or warm. Some people say they tend to oxidize over the day, so you might go one shade lighter than you'd think you need.

Also, Jung Saem Mool in their 13 series shades or the lightest of their 17 series shades (their shades are numbered like TirTir's with multiple undertone options per shade number) is a really lovely formula.

Lastly, if you're down for the splurge, the Hera black cushion in 13N1, 17N1, or 17C1 is awesome.

I've also heard good things about Banila Ultimate White cushion and Clio as more budget friendly options, but I haven't tried them yet.

Another thing to note if you're making your first jump to cushion foundations is that using a spatuala and mixing with a bit of BB cream (the Missha Perfect Cover and the FusionCell C are my faves), blending outward from the center of the face in thin layers, and then using a damp beauty blender sponge to press it in and absorb any excess is sort of the ultimate k beauty perfect skin base method, but if you're just looking for an easy press on and go for the daily, you don't need to do all that!

Unfortunately, it contains the UV filter Tinsorb M (Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol). 

That UV filter comes in the form of a stark white insoluble powder, so it's just as bad as mineral UV filters on darker skin tones. Some people even consider it to be a ""hybrid filter"" for that reason. 

I'm also black, and I always advise people to look out for the specific problematic ingredients in products you're interested in rather than ask about white cast. Lots of people will just make a judgment call regarding white cast on their own skin, but by knowing the ingredients you can consistently avoid having issues. 

My personal favorite currently is the Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Aqua Fresh Sunscreen. Pretty much perfectly fits all of your criteria. I also love the Missha All Around Safe Block Sun Essence SPF 45.

nmz3uht,1ons546,AsianBeauty,EllenYeager,"- SPF SPF SPF SPF SPF. Make sure you wear a hat or use a parasol if it’s really sunny. Your sunscreen is your last line of defence in the sun. Don’t bother with stick or spray, get a good old liquid sunscreen and slap a good amount on your face. The best sunscreen is whatever you will consistently so find a brand that you really like. I have been using Anessa Perfect Milk for 10+ years. 

- Vitamin C. Use whatever concentration your skin will tolerate, my skin is sensitive and I can’t use anything stronger than the Rohto Melano Premium Essence atm. 

- Skin usually gets dryer as you age so look into deep moisturizing products if you notice your skin drying out. Wrinkles are more obvious on dehydrated skin. I’m currently using the TIRTIR ceramic ampoule and moisturizer.

in terms of essences/lotions, i find keeping my moisture barrier intact and keeping my skin very moisturized has been huge for making my skin appear firmer and with fewer lines.

* any moisturizer with 5% urea is extremely, extremely loved by my skin, which is very dry and prone to irritation. the zeroid 5% urea cream is my holy grail, but also annoyingly expensive.
* i also really enjoy torriden's DIVE IN toner pads & their ceramide lotion (i can't recall the name but it's the one in the yellow bottle).
* abib collagen masks are amazing! i have tried a bunch of milky sheet masks since i got a huge haul when i was in seoul last month and have been really impressed by these

and it goes without saying: SUNSCREEN! sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen! make sure to reapply especially if you're outside or by a sunny window!

i don't use any topical collagen, so i figured i'll cut down on trying out new skincare stuff and focus on something that can really make a difference instead. i also always believe that supplements > topical products.

Japanese sunscreens tend to value being cosmetically elegant above anything else so they aren’t usually the best for rigorous outdoor sports. The best sports one I’ve tried so far is Biore Athlizm but I just wear it to the gym. I’d still rely on a proper sports oriented one that’s rated for water resistance if I ever want to spend extended amount of time outdoors and will be swimming or sweating a lot.

I find that the care in the first week matters the most. After that, the curl is basically set - it may get gradually looser over time, but the wave shape is set, if that makes any sense.

Sometimes the reaction is a sign of a compromised barrier. 

Also, it really depends a lot on the products you are using. If you are using products with lots of active and functional ingredients or botanicals or essential oils, the problem could be that. Tiny whiteheads on the cheeks and temples sounds like a reaction to a fragrant ingredient. Butylene glycol is ubiquitous, so you may conclude it is the culprit. But it could very well be something else. Essential oils and fragrances cause tiny whiteheads, and so can epidermal growth factors.

nmtedke,1omrftv,AsianBeauty,espressoromance,"I am also Canadian and ever since Trump keeps messing with the tariff situation here, I've chosen to mainly stick to Canadian products as well out of solidarity to my own country.

I do like using:
- Mediheal pads
- Haru Haru black rice toner

And I only use Korean or Japanese facial sunscreens. Those are by far the most superior and much cheaper. I'll never give up my Asian sunscreens. 

One of my closest friends used to work in the skincare industry and was actually one of the first beauty bloggers to discover Beauty of Joseon and write about it. We have many discussions about skincare products. I have been given a giant bag of samples of skincare products from another friend and tried many, many brands - Asian and Western. My friends and I have a group chat for skincare and we're constantly sharing information on things we're trying. 

However, being Canadian sometimes the effort to get Korean products is too much of a hassle for the possibility the product breaks me out. It's time consuming to check ingredients and also take a risk on things that won't work. 

So I'm not gonna bother when now in 2025, I also prefer to use products from small Canadian businesses who do a lot of great research into developing some amazing products to support my fellow countrymen.",2,1762137608.0,Discovered that I’m sensitive to butylene glycol 🧴
nmu3zp1,1omrftv,AsianBeauty,Unfair_Finger5531,"If you want to support your own country by buying Canadian, fine. But the level of nuance displayed in your response exceeds the statement that you “can’t use a lot of Korean products.” The Korean skincare industry is not only massive but also influential and leads the way in skincare innovations, which your “fellow countrymen” benefit from in many ways. You absolutely *could* use a lot of Korean skincare products because a great many differ very little from products from in Canada. But you choose not to do so for certain practical reasons. 

Your nationalistic fervor seems rather tone deaf on a subreddit dedicated to Asian beauty. And because your last paragraph subtly implies that research is a key element in Canadian skincare, I want to underscore that Korean beauty products are also grounded in research and scientific studies, which are often overlooked by western-centric scholars—until they are needed to justify duplicating korean formulations in western nations.

I am trying to imagine going over to the Canadian skincare subreddit and saying “I can’t use a lot of Canadian skincare because it breaks me out,” and I cannot. It seems both provocative and dismissive.",1,1762148937.0,Discovered that I’m sensitive to butylene glycol 🧴

Edit: forgot to mention I also have some gentle exfoliating products. Gotta remove the dead skin, especially cause I use retinaldehyde.

nmhx9ya,1olgza6,AsianBeauty,womensboxers,"I first want to start my review by saying that I feel like some of these blushes were unnecessary/not-worth purchases. Mainly the Dior and Clinique blush. I also listed a decent amount of Western blushes because I have either seen a lot of Korean MUAs/makeup shops carry them, or because I think the shade would be very popular if sold in Korea.

I've seen a lot of complaints about the Dior blush having 0 pigment, but I think it's due to consumers trying to swatch in-store using their finger. It did take a lot of digging in my pan to produce this finger swatch, but a low-density brush picks up the pigment 100x better. That said, I feel like this blush got duped by 10 other brands and there's just way better formulations for a similar pricepoint, like Gucci, Armani, YSL, or Patrick Ta. It's not blurring at all like the other blushes in the list, it's just a wash of color that doesn't do much for my complexion and it's almost too dark for a blue-pink, at least for my liking.

I love the Clinique blush, but it's not worth the pain in the ass it takes to get it shipped from Korea at a markup. The color is super pretty, but damn is it hard to build up any noticeable pigment. It has very subtle pearls in the formula, which the other powder blushes in this post do not. It adds a slight shininess to the cheeks without it looking like glitter. I've been using it for about a year now and hit pan, but also, I've been using it very sparingly because I just really hate having things shipped from overseas. Plus, I feel like the two shades above it (Rom&nd and Dasique) are lowkey dupes for it when applied to the cheeks. Also, while I didn't swatch them today, I have the Melon & Pansy pop shades. If anyone is curious, I will answer in a further comment but this review is already long enough on it's own.

I have conflicting thoughts about both of the Rom&nd blushes. The ""deeper"" one (it's not deep at all), Blueberry Chip, is the perfect daily shade for me--it's a perfect mute/neutral pink that doesn't look like skin irritation--and I don't need to use much of it. I see a lot of Korean MUAs/YouTubers use the Strawberry one as a ""blush base"" and while I do notice a slight improvement in blending and saturation when doing that, the blush is SO POWDERY that it's just annoying to use. It flies everywhere. And while it blends very smoothly, I hate the fallout and mess it makes in the pan if you're rushing in the mornings like I am. If I had to describe the texture of this blush, it'd be like flour or powdered sugar--very fluffy.

The Dasique blushes feel like ""watered down"" versions of the Rom&nd blushes. Less pigmentation, but also less fallout. It feels more chalky than it does powdery. I need to build it up a lot with the brush. But I do find myself reaching for the coral shade a lot as it's very fluorescent and makes my blush stand out (without looking garish/clown-y). It's a good product for the price, and as a very pale person I'm not concerned with the lack of pigment that those with deeper skin tones might find an issue with.

Finally, the Patrick Ta blushes have to be my current favorite. No fallout and very buildable. I am yet to try the ""cream-over-powder"" technique that Patrick Ta recommends because that has not consistently worked for my other cream blushes including Dior and Armani; it's a hit-or-miss technique. I noticed for the ""She's That Girl"" shade, however, the cream is very obviously cool-leaning while the powder is extremely warm so I kinda feel like I threw half of my money away--but I like the formulation and color of the cream so much that I'm fine with that. It also reminds me of AOU's blush in the Peony shade, but that's just me imagining things--if someone has it, feel free to comment a picture of it lol. I like the ""Just Enough"" duo for super cool-toned makeup looks, where I might even pop on a little bit of my purple Clinique blush.

For cool tone, I recommend heather or pink pop as I've swatched them in store before. Pansy pop is PURPLE-PURPLE. I see most Korean MUAs/influencers using it like a ""blush topper"" to shift the tone of any blush they already applied, or very lightly and sheered out to create a wash of super cool-toned pink. If you're pale, this blush will definitely last a long time as a little goes a long way",1,1762181789.0,"Swatching all my AB/AB-like blushes (neutral-cool, fair)"

nmlu86f,1olye7f,AsianBeauty,Spirited_Cupcake3744,"Hi! I’m looking for suitable blush/lip shades for me. I believe I have **light medium, warm leaning olive skin**, but I attached two photos of me in different lightings so you can see my exact skin/lip tone.

https://preview.redd.it/xkd6qzilvpyf1.jpeg?width=3972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=113842cc80be66f72248c41df367b561cb0f29d9

Here’s **my experience with the blush shades** I have:

1. Judydoll glow blush balm: shade 04 spring breeze - my favorite so far, I prefer nude, warm shades, tho it might be a bit “orange”/not peachy-rosy enough for my liking.
2. Canmake cream cheek: shade 16 Almond Terracotta - I think it suits me…but in some lightings makes my olive skin look more olive/yellowish-green 😭
3. Judydoll Gradient Blush: shade 02 Peach Cloud - I think this one suits me the best if it weren’t so light. It’s also the most similar to my natural blush color, which is soft, neutral—>warm (?) pink
4. Red Chamber Haruki Blush: shade Monsia - way too *ashy*, makes me look kinda bruised and “vampire” like.
5. Canmake Glow Fleur Cheeks: shade Milky Red - pretty suitable for me, but I prefer but less red and more nude/not as vibrant.

**Some lip shades I have:**

* Rom&nd Glasting Color gloss:

1. Rose Finch - slightly too pink and “colorful” against my skin for my liking.
2. Deepen Moor - I love it. However it doesn’t match my ideal blush shade and can come off as too deep/darkly colored.
3. Joocyee Glazed Rouge: shade Frozen Black Tea - too bright, a pop of reddish coral color for me. The advertised color would’ve been a lot better imo.
4. Nude reju lip gloss: Shade Apple Blended - I love this color when I wear it with my black hoodie, but it can sometimes be too red in a slightly vibrant way.
5. Judydoll Ice Cool lip essence lip glaze: shade Earl Grey ice - Why. Just why?? The advertised color was near perfection (perhaps but warm) for me but it pulled sooooo orange and bit brownish. Least favorite shade.

Anyway, my **ideal** lip color is one that’s as close to my **natural lip color** as possible and lines up the best with my **skin tone**. My ideal blush color would also go really well with my skin tone and be close to my natural blush color (**peachy, slightly dusty, neutral soft pink**).

The main struggle I’m having is **finding lip and blush shades that meet my respective requirements while being similar to/complementing one another.**

Thank you for reading, please comment all your shade pairing recommendations!

If you have any suggestions for a moisturizing **matte/satin/not glossy finish lip product** that doesn’t separate into lip lines, please lmk too! Thanks :) 🙏",2,1762035437.0,"Anything Goes Saturday: November 01, 2025"

I never use it during the summer but as soon as the leaves turn yellow my lips become a cracked mess so my bag will contain some kind of a lip product or at least decanted vaseline.

When I inspected the eye area that burned I saw a burn 1cm*1cm on my under eye area with spots that were brown (some are still brown after two years but much less noticeable maybe because of retinal).

Because I’ve had the same experience mixing too much glycerin in my moisturizer before too, then slugging over it with oil. And I’m fine with all of that in reasonable amounts. The over hydration irritation I get is this redness, itchiness, and tiny pustules that do not look like acne. And it always takes a few days of subjecting it to the glazed donut treatment before it starts creeping up, first with the mildest itch. 

Have had this with Korean sunscreens and also ampoules/serums (wrote about it happening with Iunik beta glucan elsewhere in this thread). No problems with my beloved Zeroid moisturizers though 1,2-hexanediol is not as high in the ingredients there. Maybe it’s also about how one usually uses less moisturizer vs other skincare products.

I'm also in Europe, and two of my orders were charged customs fees. Yesstyle refunds it in the form of credit, which is just so frustrating because that's not REALLY a refund. It obviously causes us to buy more.

On one of their sales, they marked some items I wanted as in stock -- turns out, they were never in stock, they were actually completely discontinued by the manufacturer. But I'd added other items to get free shipping, and they wouldn't let me cancel them. What a waste of packaging and fuel. I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't an accident.

nmo3uwk,1oksk0u,AsianBeauty,AppropriateBeing9885,"I literally just had a bad experience with them, too! I was wondering if anyone's experience had changed recently! I was only on my second order with them. 

My situation: items that said they'd be with them in 7-14 days weren't there after 14 days. I then had to contact them to discuss it even though not getting something within an advertised timeframe is obviously an issue on the sellers end. They then said I could keep waiting (but that they had no idea when they'd get those products) or refund the non-supplied items and ship the rest. I left extra days, just to see if they'd end up eventually getting the things. They didn't, and I then sent an email on October 29, asking whether, instead of what they suggested, I could just substitute/add other products I wanted that cost more, obviously at my additional cost. Given what a saga it was turning out to be, when they didn't reply promptly to the email, I ended up contacting them again through the chat feature to get that clarification, feeling like enough time had already been wasted (the answer was no!) I then opted that day to just have the rest shipped. They then sat on the order for several days after that, which I thought was kind of wild after everything else! Ultimately, I put in the order on October 11 and it was only shipped yesterday.

I didn't really have issues with the other order I made before this, but couldn't believe how convoluted this became. Because it took so long, I ended up having to locally buy another serum and lotion at our wack Australian prices because I'd been waiting so long for the stuff in the order to get to me that I was running low on what I use, and genuinely had no idea when I'd ever see the Yesstyle products because of how annoying this whole timeline was. I also so agree about the annoyance of getting their marketing emails while going ""Yeah, okay...but where's the stuff I already ordered, damn it?!"" I also think it's not good policy for unsupplied product refunds to be automatically given as store credit and only provided as a genuine refund if a customer takes an extra step, when this is specifically happening in the context of a business not supplying items it said it could. Like, I didn't change my mind about the products. The shop changed its ability to supply items. Why do customers then need to opt-in to a bona fide refund that potentially takes 30 days? 

I know it's skin products and I don't have some emergency need for them, but some of this just isn't good business practice and I don't feel like it's that hard to realise that this would be annoying to customers. Maybe the business just has so much money and so many customers that they don't really care about bothering some, though - especially due to how competitive their prices are and how massive the range is.",2,1762068687.0,Never ordering from Yesstyle again

Review: Beauty of Joseon rice and probiotics sunscreen. This sunscreen is my holy grail because I've finally found one which moisturizes me enough. This glides on like butter and is so soft and smooth. This, however, is not water and sweat resistant so you might wanna reapply but other than that the texture is like whipped cream. One thing that I've noticed is that it also calms down the skin because the ingredients are barrier repairing as well. Redness calms down. For me, it definitely sinks in, very hydrating and moisturizimg, plus it gives that radiance and luminosity that is just chef's kiss. Reapplication is smooth too. It has no fragrance. I wish this sunscreen was a moisturizer, like same ingredients, same texture for my PM skincare routine.

Hi! So i have acne prone skin (or had?? As i was on accutane and the acne completely went away, didnt have a single breakout since then) but i had some bumps which felt like just congestion deep inside my skin. I never used anything special for my skincare, just salicylic acid facewash and moisturizer + spf. My skin is on the drier+dehydrated side but my nose can get oily. It has been 2 years since i got done with accutane.

So i started using this serum around 3 weeks ago (nights) along with the centella tone brightening ampule (morning). My moisturizer & facewash are the same.  I started getting smallll breakouts (some are pus filled, some become whiteheads) around my mouth (the congestion usually was around my mouth. if i sort of stretched the skin u could see it, but in the daylight) since a couple of days ago. 

Could this be purging? Im kind of terrified because i had acne most of my life and accutane saved me. Im so scared of having it again ... i hope this IS purging and not acne making a comeback... i dont think there was this much congestion around my mouth??",1,1762044272.0,"HAVE A QUESTION? ASK HERE!

Top Skin Concern: Patches of texture on my right cheek, faint fine line on forehead

Current Routine/Products I am Using:
Actives: Tretinoin Cream, Glycolic Acid, Vitamin C, Numbuzin Glow Toner Pads (contain PHA/LHA)
Hydrating/Soothing: Centella Hydrating Mist Spray, Centella Hyaluronic Acid
Barrier Support: Laneige Water Bank Moisturiser, Purito Barrier Cream

AM Routine: (The routine I'm currently following)
1.  Numbuzin Glow Toner Pads 
2.  Laneige Vitamin C 
3.  Centella Hyaluronic Acid
4.  Centella Hydrating Mist Spray
5.  Laneige Moisturiser 
6.  BOJ Sunscreen

PM Routine: (I am alternating actives with rest days to avoid irritation)

Tretinoin Nights (Mon/Fri): Cleanse > Tretinoin > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream
Glycolic Nights (Wed): Cleanse > Numbuzin Pads > Glycolic Acid > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream
Rest/Repair Nights: Cleanse > Centella Mist > Centella HA > Purito Barrier Cream 


I'm looking for feedback on whether the alternating PM routine is safe and effective for treating the texture while managing the dryness. I also am suspicious that the Purito cream may be making my face sting a little but am not sure if it’s due to the cream or overdoing my actives. The stinging only started 4/5 weeks into using tretinoin around the time I got the Purito cream. 

Any help is greatly appreciated!!",1,1762098013.0,"HAVE A QUESTION? ASK HERE! Alter-Daily Help and Questions: October 31, 2025"

nmclxoa,1ok2qlh,AsianBeauty,Southern-Scar6916,"Sorry babes I don't have time to go full on into this and pull out my whole collection. It's vast.

The issue with most tints is they're actually brighter than this shade (which I love) e.g. things like lilybryred Blackberry Tequila or 3CE ""Spiced Up"" in Lazy Pop Stain. I have a million plum vamps, and 332 K-Tints but we're not on speaking terms atm (Bright. Bright little girl colours I just can't).

https://preview.redd.it/f751heqidfyf1.jpeg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=281ffd1577e31ba65297967b06eaa4d20d8621e9

Girlcult J808 and Dinto 216 ""Umbra"" are pretty much bang on to the Uhue U05 Like amazing close. Dinto you will need to layer to get the pigment.

Uhue MIrror Lipstick in G625. That's a more purple vamp than brown red, but it's a gorgeous vamp and it's still got that shine and sheerness if you want the comfort and a bit more ""soft goth""

Uhue Gloss in U06 is a similar tone, it's just much more sheer, a bit lighter and a bit less vamp and has glitter in it. That is actually still available through ""LookHealthyStore"". I've bought through them (Chinese) b4. Hyntoor's OG old Whimsical Planet Watery Lip Gloss in 002. Probably skip it tho, too sheer. Couldn't find it.

""Romantic Goth""? I'm old and goth goth, but I'm trying to think outside the box:

Pinate Bare Glow Peptide Melting Balm in ""Sequence"". It's similar to Uhue U06 it's sort of sheer plummy but with gorgeous glitter. It's ""classy sheer vamp"".  
Into You Glowing Lipstick in ML07 (Mauve) -  this is so classy and muted purple. It's romantic. I love it.  
Derol (YesStyle) Sugar Candy Glossy Balm ""Dominant"" is a deep vamp burgundy, Messy and all other shades are not nice but it's so cheap.  
Shellwe Makeup x Freya86 Punk Bunny Collection Gloss. It is beautiful. didn't swatch 'cos I knew it was a deep cool-tone but check it out. It's a lovely vamp and could be worn more sheer, too.  
Fenty Gloss Stix in ""Black'r Berry - she deep vamp tho, but you could sheer it out.  
Girlcult obvs. Sheered out, J809 and J816 might work in Lip Glaze, they're pretty deep though FYI, L06 Nightfeast (sheered out also) could look sort of ""classy goth"", but again that's a very deep brownish vamp like the others, I think the Mirror Glaze J7X's might be too gothy. J808 is a huge contender tho, just remember it tastes like roses.  
Rom&nd Deep Sangria JLT if you can still get it. It's not this but it's vampy/soft goth. Plum Coke if you don't mind a bit brighter. The black tint is back in the mini TJLT now (some of the mini Glasting Glosses are fun colours/colour changers)  
Heart Percent Dote On Mood Top Coating Lip Plumper in Mood Changer is a deep plum, so cool-toned, but could be handy to just mute and vamp down some of your existing collection.  
Don't overlook Revlon or L'Oreal on this.

More Goth Goth:

Hyntoor released some new shades recently, including a more trad red in their lip mud (B02 ""Carrie"") but not so close to this, it's more of a cool-tone or neutral-red, plus a black mirror gloss squeeeeeeee). Also look at their Dark Style Reverse Macaroon Lip Muds and the Subversive Series in their lip muds.  
Kaleidos lip muds, not shine, but they have several gorgeous brown red shades e.g. Cognac and Bloodstone, check out their other vamp reds like Rubino or Smeared Rouge, they're cooler-toned tho  
DRAMO Moonlight in the Bottle Lip Mud Series  
CARMELA Renaissance and Waste Soil Collection Lip Mud Series  
Girl's Crush (Red Thorn and Black Rivet are lovely)  
Parper Lab have some rad lip muds/liquid lips (black, white, vamp)  
Other than that it's Western indie for me so I'll leave it there.",32,1761908539.0,looking for lip tints w this color or any other romantic goth lippie recs are welcome!

It's brighter and not as pigmented, but it's sort of got that romantic girly sot vamp to it. Uhue is in the middle. The sheer gloss part is a lovely sort of plum w/glitter not too unlike Uhue U06.

nmkw5yf,1ok2qlh,AsianBeauty,Southern-Scar6916,"Hiya. Me again (sorry mods I didn't realise I couldn't give other Western recs in one post).

So, I've just been thinking today that you might be after that picture's colour (which is stunning) and not what the actual Uhue gloss looks like IRL, it does tend to come off deeper which is why Gircult J808 and Dinto 261 Umbra (I think I kept reversing my numbers on that) are decent matches. You could sheer it right out I guess but to get that nice shine I need to pile it on. 

So, I can't give you my Western rec I found but I was making room for my new Rom&nd releases and I thought I'd just show you these two from Rom&nd (3 technically but that was a play around). If you want a deeper vamp or brickish red, then Zero Velvets got you covered, but I think these, especially the gloss might be a vibe for you.

https://preview.redd.it/05c831gg2pyf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61484b785101763873ec84e7b08f12442e26b3bc

Rom&nd Glasting Gloss 18 Red Bean Sirutteok. It's a mini, it's not on YS or OY yet, it's on Beauty Box Korea and a few eBay sellers I use sometimes so that's a pain but it's gorge. You need to layer to get anything like Uhue pigment (and I think you'll still fall short) and it's a bit of a different finish, but I just feel like it's such an elegant soft of ""soft"" classy vamp-lite. Bit of red, bit of plum, bit of brown.

The second is good old Rom&nd Glasting Water Tint in 17 Woody Sunset. I feel like this is going to be a little too bright overall, though depends on your lip pigment, maybe a bit too like, brown as well...but I also wonder what mixing in some of the other reds would do. 

I swatched Milk Tea Velvet Tint 2 in ""Black Tea"" sheered right out (that's quite browny plum, but sheers out to more of a vamp plum, not on par with what you're after but it's pretty and I was just playing. Earl Grey nice too). The others at the back too bright.

As far as I know YesStyle prices include the VAT. I placed an order and it was below £135 so didn’t qualify for customs. But It states on YesStyle’s website that if we get charged fees they will reimburse us with credit.

nm5wa82,1ojs9lz,AsianBeauty,heids1234,"Certain products are worth it, to me, but I am an older woman (46) with a good amount of disposable income. I don't really have to budget/save up for skincare so I've tried a few mid to higher end products, both western and Asian brands.

Cons are they are usually fragranced, pros are more elegant formulations, advanced delivery systems and higher amounts of beneficial ingredients meaning they feel good on my skin, absorb better and deliver what they need to in a way that makes a difference to me.

Note that my routine isn't exclusively ""luxe"", I use them with more reasonably priced products. And just because they are luxe doesn't mean they would work better for everyone - case in point my favourite cleansing balm remains the BoJ cleansing balm. I prefer it to all others I have tried including Elemis (which was waxy and left a residue - ugh).

AB mid to luxury products that are staples in my routine:
- Sulwhasoo FCAS - for the glow. Works best paired with another first essence, used to be SK-II but I'm trying it out with Missha FTE to see if it works just as well.
- Sulwhasoo Ginseng cream, both classic and rich. My skin loves ginseng and this packs a punch - softening, smoothing, firming. I gave a sample of this to my 71 year old mum who was never into skincare and she now loves it as much as I do, I buy her a couple of tubs a year.
- SK-II cleansing oil - this alongside Fancl is my favourite. Skin feels so soft afterwards.
- su:m37 micro active powder wash - I use this a few times a week, particularly after makeup. Wonderful cleanser and I think a little bit exfoliating (which is why I can't use it too frequently)
- Whoo Bichup - great serum, skin softening and smoothing. I use this at night as it's too rich for my morning routine
- Sooryehan The Black Serum - same effects as Bichup but lighter consistency. The first time I used it I couldn't stop touching my face, it felt lovely and smooth.
- Amorepacific Vintage Single Extract Essence - a wonderful first essence. This one is in my evening routine, gives me a dose of antioxidants and also has a smoothing effect.",48,1761817357.0,Luxury brands/products: are they worth it?

I *do* think that online discussions of Asian beauty focus too heavily on drugstore products, such as Hada Labo, Canmake, etc.,--this isn't a problem per se (it's great if those products work for you, especially in this economy), but it's like limiting yourself to brands like NYX and Wet n Wild in non-AB. Unfortunately, a lot of midrange/luxury AB products are not very accessible overseas, which means a lot of people don't discuss them because they are simply not aware of them.

  
Personally, I don't use Korean luxury brands because I don't vibe with their traditional aesthetics (my mum and grandma love them, though...), but I love Japanese department store brands. They have more interesting but still very wearable and stylish shades compared to drugstore brands when it comes to makeup products, plus some great foundations and primers. I also enjoy luxury skincare but do note that a lot (most?) of them contain fragrance. Some of my favorite brands are: Shu Uemura (their legendary cleansing oil), IPSA (toners), Cosme Decorte (sunscreen, liposome skincare line), Celvoke (their makeup line in general, cleansing oil, facial oil), Addiction Tokyo (makeup), THREE (makeup).

As i've moved into my 30s i've started exploring luxury skincare and there are hits and misses of course. Lux products are usually formulated for an older demographic which has both its pros and cons. (Pros: cosmetic elegance, packaging, lots of R&D around products/ingredients, they don't discontinue products easily. Cons: heavily fragraced, products are heavier and can be worse for acne prone skin, don't follow skincare trends as closely)

I think if you have the disposable income, its fun to try some luxury products. I would recommend getting sample packs before buying anything full size, and also wait for sales. Sales on lux products can be a bit more rare, but i never pay full price for lux products!

Lux products worth the money to me:

My take is buy what works for you and save the $$$ for cosmetic procedures. 

Long answer is it depends. 

If you are 30 something with decent skin, $575 Cle de Peau La Creme is not going to give you 10 times visible result than $40 Aestura cream. Your skin might look a little plumper, glowier but it's not going to be night and day. 

I have no problem buying expensive foundation if it gives me the coverage and finish I want. In my experience, the luxury brand tends to have foundation with better textures, less clogging, more color range and better packaging. As for  point makeup, I don't think my make up look that much different using $20 pallette vs $100+ pallette. 

For skincare, the uber expensive ones are lovely, feel more luxurious and smell a lot better, but they still don't erase fine lines or discoloration for me.

Got my second bottle in 2024 from cosme in Tokyo. Then they had the tsuya version of it and was contemplating getting it. Still stuck to the OG

Got my third bottle last week at their store in Daimaru, Sapporo (colder climate) after the reformulation (advanced). Had the same dilemma picking the matte one or the Tsuya one asked my sis to help me decide which looks better after getting swatched by the MUA.

I got ultim8 as a travel sized sample, works pretty good as well, makes my skin legit feel moisturized.

Currently I’m using the black one (pores), I say it’s alright just the texture of the oil is watery compared to the green and ultim8. No decrease in QOL so far

nm4zd5v,1ojpm1e,AsianBeauty,Legally_Blonde_258,"Even dermatologists (or at least the ones I follow) say that the minimal skincare routine is just a starting point and that you should add additional products if necessary to meet your skin's needs. So for me, thats where I start. My skin needed tret for acne. Which meant that it needed way more hydration bc of the tret. So I had to add products to address that. Finally found the balance and now my skin is happy and so am I.

In terms of choosing products, I look for those that are intended to meet the need that I have. Sometimes it's based on a long track record of proven results (tret for acne). Other resources include recommendations from people who have similar skin type/needs, understanding what ingredients are likely to be beneficial or harmful to my skin in particular based on past experience, expert advice on specific products that are good for people with my needs (e.g. lists of good moisturizers for people on tret). But there's also some element of trial and error, which requires closely observing your skin to see how it reacts to new products and figuring out what you need to do different to better meet its needs.",15,1761798178.0,“Minimalist” skincare: how do you build your routine?

You didn’t even say what your skincare goals are, so that makes it hard for people to offer input. It takes time and trial and error to scale down a routine that fits your needs. 

Also, lotion is not optional when you use retinoids. And it definitely isn’t when you use retinoids AND vitamin c daily. One thing about a “minimalist” routine is that it can actually be harmful to the barrier when you remove basic products. The scaling back needs to be thoughtful and reasonable. It isn’t just removing items; it’s also about knowing what to keep. Anything that supports your barrier and hydration should be in the routine. Whether you need niacinamide and Aza—only you know that.

I personally have a “base routine.” It is products that I use every single day, no matter what. From there, I bring in actives as I need them based on what I’m trying to achieve. It took me about three years to get the base routine down.

1) figure out your skin type

2) what skin concern(s) are you trying to address

3) look into products that help that skin concern. Read online reviews, compare reviews on YouTube, reddit the official site etc. to gauge. If people had issues with the product see why, and what issues caused.

4) pop all the items you are interested in your cart, and asses them together as a whole routine or addition to your current routine and with your budget. The goal to to not have too many repetitive products, as too many products can also cause a negative effect. Also question whether this is smth you really need or are getting cause it's hyped up online and you've seen ""amazing"" effects.

C. Does it have long term benefits or been researched on? What does the medical literature suggest? Is it a fad?

nm5391o,1ojpm1e,AsianBeauty,SweetDorayaki,"I found the top-down approach to be easier for myself (otherwise I'd be way more lost and overwhelmed by all the available stuff on the market):

- Identify main skin concerns and know your skin type
- Rank in order of importance/largest impact 
- research clinically backed ingredients that address the top 1-2 concerns. Often, ingredients may have multiple benefits, and sometimes ingredients have different chemical forms, differing pros/cons (e.g. faster results but also increased risk of irritation), and sometimes have concentrations that are more effective vs more gentle. Pick one or two ingredients that address the top concern(s).
- Set a budget for how much you want to spend, then research the products that have your key ingredient at a clinically effective concentration. Narrow down to 3 max to consider.
- To decide between products, I compare online reviews (I find 3-4 star reviews to be more reliable), see if anyone on reddit with similar skin type and issues have shared their experience with the product, and see if any dermatologists online have reviewed the product. All sponsored reviews are taken with a large grain of salt, I generally don't trust/look for input from influencers either, but in this day and age we are all susceptible lol.
- Price and ease of purchase/receipt of product also is considered. I often add items to the cart and let it sit for at least a day, if not a week. That way I can be more confident it's not an impulse buy bc I was influenced into it.
- After receiving it, know that consistency is key when applying products. Also, introduce new products slowly (especially if the ingredients are known to be irritating), then increase the frequency I use it",11,1761800096.0,“Minimalist” skincare: how do you build your routine?

So, I have been using my Apagard Premio from Amazon and I watched a video that mentioned that if I use Nano Hydroxypatite, after washing my teeth I should get a gritty feeling on my teeth from the Hydroxypatite crystalization, so I started to have doubts on my tooth paste as I never get a gritty sensation afterwards on my teeth, then I got from Google's ai that the paste itself should be soft and it shouldn't have a gritty, sandy texture like other toothpastes, can someone confirm if that's true? The one I bought has indeed a sandy texture when I bite into it, the box is very pretty but now I am unsure, help!  
I need to know multiple things:

1. Have I wasted money TT . TT
2. Have I wasted time with a bad paste XC
3. I need to confirm to give my reviews to the seller and listing to prevent other customers from thinking it's the real deal

Not to be a big nerd (even though I am) but that's actually not what they are for or do. You can put these patches on any type of pimple or mark caused from inflammation and it will be reduced, because these patches dont actually work by sucking the pus but instead creating a tiny microenviornment (thats sealed and moist) between the patch and your skin that's perfect for wound healing and absorbing any excess fluid.",122,1761744429.0,MICRONEEDLE pimple patches?

I probably won't be buying new shades until they reformulate, because the affected shades are pretty unclear, and people unaffected could just have one of the safe shades or are just have really resilient lips. I would buy confirmed safe shades that I like through.

nmxxwzn,1oifluq,AsianBeauty,InconvenientFruit,"My mileage varied with individual Rom&nd lip products. The product I find most drying is is their matte lipstick, which isn't a tint at all.

However, I really didn't like the reformulated JLT and found it less moisturizing than other tints with similar thickness. Their Glasting water tint was also less moisturizing than other tints with a similar thickness, but I really like the effect and staining power. On the contrary, while I didn't find their Dewyful water tint drying at all, I had so many other issues with it that despite loving the shade I own, I never reach for it.

I'd repurchase their original JLT without hesitation if I could find them between all its reformulations, but I'll likely wait for them to reformulate before repurchasing other lip products.

For context, I have mildly sensitive, slightly dry skin with occasional mild acne flare-ups (former Accutane user). And I live in a warm, dry climate. 

There are better sunscreens out there for more reasonable prices. I’m really liking house of hur weightless sun fluid right now. I also preferred Numbuzin no. 1 clear filter sun essence and Tocobo bio watery sun essence wayyy over the anessa. 

The only major pro for this sunscreen vis a vis other AB sunscreens is that it’s waterproof. But tbh I’d rather use a non-ab waterproof sunscreen on summer days in the outdoors than the anessa.

I mostly enjoy that it’s impossible to sweat/rub off once set, I have not stained any of my light coloured tops/hoodies which used to be an issue. Sometimes the talc can leave some white powdery residue but it doesn’t stain. Taking it off is the main concern to avoid clogging, careful oil cleansing is needed. I don’t wear skincare under. Sometimes it comes out uneven, a random spot will peel then other days it looks amazing like a filter. It’s shiny and tone-up on my already very fair skin. The white cast seems unavoidable unless you under-apply. Sensitivity-wise I love it, surprisingly, even though I’m eczema/dermatitis prone but keep in mind it is not FA safe. Since using it I have much less pigmentation from spots (which makes me think BOJ was not enough). I mostly don’t like that it feels thick on the skin (due to silicone) and reapplying is weird because it won’t really sink in like the first layer (but necessary).

nlyj3cb,1oioelj,AsianBeauty,parcelofmilk,"I guess I’m a bit of an outlier here and maybe the sunscreen has a different formulation where ai am—but I’ve used this sunscreen for nearly five years have very sensitive dry skin undergoing retinoid treatment and I’m also eczema prone. The weather where I am cycles through hot and VERY humid, and really dry windy winters.

The gold bottle is my favourite one after cycling through many popular Japanese sunscreens (I’m based in Japan). Like others said, the alcohol, white cast and mild fragrance might cause issues though, but it never really did for me. To compare, the popular Biore Watery Essence and Nivea UV cut variants burned and irritated the bajeezus out of my skin (alcohol content makes those ones feel astringent) and other sunscreens went on like white paint in comparison to this one. After that experience, to me Anessa felt similar to LRP’s Anthelios.

I’m surprised that many find the difficulty in washing the product off as a negative. It IS difficult to wash off—which makes it so that it doesn’t slip around and slide into my eyes during really hot or rainy days. To remove it, I use an oil cleanser (I use Muji mild cleansing) or micellar water (on lazy days I use Bifesta)—foaming cleansers will likely strip your skin as you rub your face trying to remove it, which I guess exacerbates whatever irritation is being reported. 

It sits well after my skincare and I find no problem with it interacting with my makeup or reapplication—it acts like a smoothing primer even. If I have a dry patch or a flareup, I try to get all of my required moisture in before putting on sunscreen (as well as medication), and I try to make sure that my skincare and makeup don’t repel each other (which is what causes pilling).

I know you probably have decided, but I thought since we had the same skin type, these are some addt’l points for consideration!",1,1761714218.0,"Cons of Anessa sun milk sunscreen? (E.g. pilling, drying, burning, matte effect, sensitivity, etc.)"

I noticed a difference to my skin pretty much immediately when I started using it, and I had no issues during the introduction, which went pretty fast due to the.. no issues.   
I put it on it every night as my second product after toner, and have no issues pairing it together with my other products like retinal, niacinamide and azelaic acid etc.   


In general my skin has improved during that period and I'm less red, not as dry and not as reactive as I usually am, I have reduced wrinkles and slightly better texture. THAT BEING SAID I'm not sure if that's because of the general ingredients in the ampoule, or because it allows my other skin care products to just work better. Either way, it has become a staple in my routine. When I run out of it I might try the VT Reedle shots to see if I get a different result, but in general I'm very happy with it and am very happy to keep using it!",5,1761638513.0,Experiences with spicules

I bought a Heroine eyeliner with a brush tip this spring and have been using it fairly often over the summer and fall. The past 3 months however, the eyeliner only seems good for two wings before it refuses to lay down any more pigment. I make a wing on each eye and if I mess it up, wipe it off, and try to draw again, no more pigment comes off the tip. When I make a stroke on the back of my hand going from the base of the brush to the tip, THEN it releases pigment, but still not on the tip.

I've tried cleaning the brush well, storing it tip-down, rinsing it off, shaking before applying, and nothing works.

nltq6j9,1ohgz5c,AsianBeauty,RadiantStarr,"The madecassoside pads are more for calming and soothing skin than oil control. I recommend trying a niacinamide product. You'll hit the birds with one stone— oil control and brightening/fading PIH. 5% is the sweet spot but higher concentrations like 10% can be suitable for oily skin for oil control (but can also be more irritating so beware). Some products that's might interest you:


- Peach Slices Pore Serum - 5% niacinamide + zinc
- Dr G Niacinamide Booster - 10% niacinamide + zinc + BHA (a chemical exfoliant that can help with oil control and keeping pores clear)
- Be Minimalist Niacinamide - 10% niacinamide + zinc + acetyl glucosamine (another brightening ingredients)
- Cos de Baha has a few different niacinamide products but unsure what's going on with their rebranding/reformulations atm


These are just the ones I could find with zinc, which is also great for oil control and pores but can also be drying. There are a lot of 5% and 10% niacinamide products out there and some with even higher concentration of niacinamide (15% and even 20%!). But I'm not convinced more is better.

20% aza is kinda high (if it really is a 20% aza product that is. Honestly you might be better off with kisocare who actually claims to have 20% aza or reaching out to VT to confirm concentration if you still want this concentration).

nllyywf,1ogm5z7,AsianBeauty,Echothrush,"Whoah me too! Full East Asian, inexplicable brown hair. It’s probably weird Northern Chinese “barbarian genetics” in my case (lots of Korean, Manchu, Russian/Siberian genetics where my family is from and in our family tree). …On the plus side, does the brown give you that nice coarse-almost-wavy texture? Now that I’ve learned to treat my hair like it’s wavy, not straight, other asian friends are all jelly bc if I just wash it and twist it in a bun, it dries down in big loose waves, even loose princess curls if I use curl cream. One of my friends got a k-perm to get her straight hair to do the same thing. Kids were really mean about it when I was young though… All through childhood, the ONLY thing I wanted was naturally smooth straight heavy black hair like the other asian kids had—no straightener needed! I used to dream of getting keratin treatments lol. But once I started using wavy hair products instead of straight hair products and embraced my natural texture, my beauty life got so much easier :’)

OP your hair looks so dark and gorgeous but our texture actually sounds pretty similar! I might be a little closer to 1C-2A… but it’s trippy for me bc I associate your blue-black raven’s wing color with the “classic asian” dark smooth almost glass-texture hair, not coarse hair like ours. ig Mise en Scène is shooting to the top of my must try list ;) (And if you’re ever in the market for curl cream lol, lmk.

nlp8agt,1ogm5z7,AsianBeauty,HeQiulin,"Thank you! I had so much fun reading this. You have a knack for writing. I’ve never felt more flattered with such fancy words 

The curly ends are result of a hair iron lol. But you are right, my hair is about 1C. It used to be 2A but for some reason, it’s now at 1C. I think because they’re all the same length and I have a lot of hair, it’s too heavy to form waves. When it’s wet, you can see some light waves. The moment it dries, it’s bone straight. Hence the usage of the hair iron for the curly ends. But when it’s shorter, I saw some waves. 

I actually think the “glass hair” has more to do with hair tone and texture than actual coarseness/fine nature of hair. If you have flatter (as in straight hair) and darker surface, it would just reflect light better. 

I am also so happy to hear you embracing your natural texture. I always believe our hair is at its healthiest and best when we go with the flow instead of working against it.

nljgbkj,1oguicb,AsianBeauty,EllenYeager,"I used to live in a very dry climate and the moisture barrier of my scalp was soooo wrecked. my head was always itchy and flaking and I kept wondering if it was severe dandruff. 

I dont really have an AB routine for hair but here are the things that helped. 

castor oil massage and leaving it in for like 30mins before I washed my hair. I’ve heard anecdotally that castor oil is not suitable for every hair type and can cause matting so please do your research. I have typical coarse Asian hair that’s slightly wavy probably a 1c or 2a. castor oil is sticky and messy so I usually only did this once a week.

dandruff shampoo with zinc to help the inflammation. really rub it into your scalp when you’re washing your hair. I used the Cerave one and it worked fine. 

I used the oshima tsubaki oil and massaged it into my scalp when it was fully dry, especially in the areas that tend to itch and flake. A little does go a long way, I didn’t have to use very many drops each time. I like it but it’s also not knocking my socks off either and I’m still looking for potential better alternatives. I also find that it’s way too expensive to buy overseas and I wouldn’t pay double the price for it.

nlhd1w9,1oghy7u,AsianBeauty,MoonNott,"Sunscreen was my introduction. I truly thought the Asian Beauty flood was just a nonsense marketing trend. I'd grabbed random skincare at Asian markets and never been impressed (+ I remember it all being rather expensive). I was pretty burnt out on US and EU skincare at the time, jaded I suppose. I'm outside a lot though and *struggled* with sunscreen. I have some sensory stuff so the slime or greasy feeling, having all the dust and debris stick to you really sucked but I delt. But it also burned. 100s of brands and varieties, without exception all would start to make my skin tingle or feel burning, some developing rashes. I was worked out a three sunscreen rotation that kinda kept the reaction at bay. Often avoided any on my face above my cheeks so I wouldn't have red swollen eyes. 


As I was waiting on my sunscreen order from Stylevanna iirc I had added a few random things and looked around. I was at TJ Maxx, then Marshalls, Ross and started seeing the K and J beauty brands (still haven't ran into any Chinese beauty products irl around town). Maybe Asian beauty hasn't taken off here because the clearance section is always full of CorsRX, Skin1004, PrettySkin, Cosnori and more. 


I guess I had good luck because I wasn't completely read up on what ingredients to be looking for and impulsed bought. Everything was mind blowing. My skin loves centella and snail. A couple PrettySkin lotions became body lotions but still not upset- my feet feel amazing lol. The sunscreen was just life changing. I know that sounds dramatic but my husband is even wearing sunscreen daily. I don't dread putting it on and guilt for not or delaying reapplying. It's so easy when it doesn't hurt and cause more skin issues! 


So biggest thing is that everything has worked (or at least not caused issue- I mean some neck/eye creams, anti-aging stuff it's hard to tell so soon). My skin is noticeably better than before. I love the packaging and esthetics. I'm still amazed at the sizes- sunscreen does seem small to me especially if your full body every day, more difficult to find giant bottles like in the US. But the skincare all seems like decent amounts for reasonable prices- although if it disappears from all the local outlets I'm going to have to slow down lol. 


I'm now getting into Asian makeup. First thought was if the skincare is this wonderful the makeup must work well with it. I haven't been wearing any much the past couple years and after decades of full face nearly every day it now looks jarring when I do. My face has also completely changed (90# loss will do that) so needing to update. I really like the enhanced almost enchanted 'natural' look lately which I think works very well with AB products. ",2,1761489259.0,what converted you to AB?

It just comes down to I bought it, didn't like it because sticky and smelly. My peers 20-30 (in Japan) never bought it, don't really recommend it, but maybe we're just in the wrong age group. Pre-Korean cosmetic super surge during COVID, my friends were using Hada Labo, Chifure, Orbis, etc. Now, it's mostly Kbeauty. 

Replacement for Kiku? Tbh I place little stock in toners. You said Hada Labo is ""meh"", yeah same. I've tried a TON of toners, both kbeauty and jbeauty, and in the end, they're all meh. So if OP is asking about Kiku, my honest opinion is, it's also meh but sticky and smelly. 

OP said they want to target hyperpigmentation, I don't think an 800 yen bottle of Kiku is gonna make that much of a difference. OP should find a toner that suits them (hey, could be Kiku), and focus on actives instead.",7,1761493621.0,Are people still using Kikumasumune?

As long as your tube shows an SPF number (like SPF50 or SPF45) and the ingredients match the official ones, it’s definitely real. Since you got it from a store you trust, it’s likely just a legit export version with slightly different labeling.",2,1761450968.0,Round lab no pa+++??
nlg541f,1og3fty,AsianBeauty,Which-Kick1224,I think they might tag it in different way. You should look it up online for translation.,1,1761468758.0,Round lab no pa+++??
nldq14t,1og3fty,AsianBeauty,BananaZealousideal23,Thank you! Any clue whether this is anywhere near as good as a proper pa++++? Do you think I should return this?,2,1761429398.0,Round lab no pa+++??
nldry0l,1og3fty,AsianBeauty,BananaZealousideal23,"Thank you so much! This really eases my mind. I got this from a korean cosmetics retailer in spain, it’s a small chain and they’ve got a few shops around here. ",2,1761430059.0,Round lab no pa+++??
nldqmxn,1og3fty,AsianBeauty,defenestrate_urself,"TBH the pa+ rating is just as vague.

PA++++ means it's 16 or higher. The UVA in a circle for an SPF 50 is equivalent to a protecton factor of 16.6. So it's probably the same formula.",28,1761429608.0,Round lab no pa+++??
nlds40x,1og3fty,AsianBeauty,banannah09,"Then that's likely the case for them, because they're such a big brand it's not easy for small brands to become direct buyers. I wouldn't worry about it - it's perfectly legit :)",2,1761430117.0,Round lab no pa+++??
